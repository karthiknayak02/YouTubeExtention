you left the heater on all night.</text><text start="24.124" dur="1.301">You turn on the light.</text><text start="25.449" dur="1.25">It&amp;#39;s not working.</text><text start="27.252" dur="5.267">Actually, the coffee maker, the TV --
none of them are working.</text><text start="33.249" dur="2.483">Life outside also seems to have stopped.</text><text start="36.796" dur="1.828">There are no schools,</text><text start="38.648" dur="2.241">most of the businesses are shut,</text><text start="40.913" dur="2.026">and there are no working trains.</text><text start="43.852" dur="3.706">This is not the opening scene
of a zombie apocalypse movie.</text><text start="48.332" dur="5.912">This is what happened in March 1989
in the Canadian province of Quebec,</text><text start="54.268" dur="2.68">when the power grid lost power.</text><text start="57.523" dur="1.163">The culprit?</text><text start="59.106" dur="1.198">A solar storm.</text><text start="61.551" dur="3.063">Solar storms are giant clouds of particles</text><text start="64.638" dur="2.278">escaping from the Sun from time to time,</text><text start="66.94" dur="5.349">and a constant reminder that we live
in the neighborhood of an active star.</text><text start="73.157" dur="2.608">And I, as a solar physicist,</text><text start="75.789" dur="3.72">I have a tremendous chance
to study these solar storms.</text><text start="79.533" dur="2.721">But you see, &amp;quot;solar storm chaser&amp;quot;</text><text start="82.278" dur="1.672">is not just a cool title.</text><text start="84.799" dur="3.636">My research helps to understand
where they come from,</text><text start="88.459" dur="1.444">how they behave</text><text start="89.927" dur="1.175">and, in the long run,</text><text start="91.126" dur="2.998">aims to mitigate their effects
on human societies,</text><text start="94.148" dur="1.682">which I&amp;#39;ll get to in a second.</text><text start="97.106" dur="5.544">At the beginning of the space
exploration age 50 years ago only,</text><text start="102.674" dur="2.158">the probes we sent in space</text><text start="104.856" dur="2.814">revealed that the planets
in our Solar System</text><text start="107.694" dur="4.45">constantly bathe in a stream of particles
that are coming from the Sun</text><text start="112.168" dur="2.601">and that we call the solar wind.</text><text start="115.722" dur="3.617">And in the same way that global wind
patterns here on Earth</text><text start="119.363" dur="2.198">can be affected by hurricanes,</text><text start="121.585" dur="3.761">the solar wind is sometimes
affected by solar storms</text><text start="125.37" dur="3.176">that I like to call &amp;quot;space hurricanes.&amp;quot;</text><text start="129.687" dur="1.953">When they arrive at planets,</text><text start="131.664" dur="2.225">they can perturb the space environment,</text><text start="133.913" dur="3.285">which in turn creates
the northern or southern lights,</text><text start="137.222" dur="2.188">for example, here on Earth,</text><text start="139.434" dur="1.868">but also Saturn</text><text start="141.953" dur="1.953">and also Jupiter.</text><text start="145.151" dur="2.688">Luckily, here on Earth,</text><text start="147.863" dur="3.091">we are protected
by our planet&amp;#39;s natural shield,</text><text start="150.978" dur="3.111">a magnetic bubble that we call
the magnetosphere</text><text start="154.113" dur="2.378">and that you can see here
on the right side.</text><text start="157.281" dur="3.248">Nonetheless, solar storms
can still be responsible</text><text start="160.553" dur="4.614">for disrupting satellite
telecommunications and operations,</text><text start="165.191" dur="3.605">for disrupting navigation
systems, such as GPS,</text><text start="168.82" dur="2.481">as well as electric power transmission.</text><text start="171.895" dur="5.854">All of these are technologies
on which us humans rely more and more.</text><text start="178.42" dur="4.463">I mean, imagine if you woke up tomorrow
without a working cell phone --</text><text start="183.692" dur="1.553">no internet on it,</text><text start="185.269" dur="2.506">which means no social media.</text><text start="187.799" dur="2.924">I mean, to me that would be worse
than the zombie apocalypse.</text><text start="190.747" dur="1.208">(Laughter)</text><text start="192.605" dur="2.095">By constantly monitoring the Sun, though,</text><text start="194.724" dur="2.391">we now know where
the solar storms come from.</text><text start="197.753" dur="1.945">They come from regions of the Sun</text><text start="199.722" dur="3.292">where a tremendous amount
of energy is being stored.</text><text start="203.038" dur="1.512">You have an example here,</text><text start="204.574" dur="3.81">as a complex structure
hanging above the solar surface,</text><text start="208.408" dur="2.421">just on the verge of erupting.</text><text start="211.877" dur="2.886">Unfortunately, we cannot send probes</text><text start="214.787" dur="3.419">in the scorching hot
atmosphere of the Sun,</text><text start="218.23" dur="5.208">where temperatures can rise
up to around 10 million degrees Kelvin.</text><text start="224.227" dur="4.211">So what I do is I use computer simulations</text><text start="228.462" dur="4.833">in order to analyze but also to predict
the behavior of these storms</text><text start="233.319" dur="2.781">when they&amp;#39;re just born at the Sun.</text><text start="237.421" dur="2.597">This is only one part
of the story, though.</text><text start="241.486" dur="3.858">When these solar storms
are moving in space,</text><text start="245.368" dur="3.606">some of them will inevitably
encounter space probes</text><text start="248.998" dur="4.608">that we humans have sent
in order to explore other worlds.</text><text start="254.105" dur="2.833">What I mean by other worlds is,
for example, planets,</text><text start="256.962" dur="2.1">such as Venus or Mercury,</text><text start="259.086" dur="2.72">but also objects, such as comets.</text><text start="262.584" dur="2.586">And while these space probes
have been made</text><text start="265.194" dur="2.711">for different scientific endeavors,</text><text start="267.929" dur="5.137">they can also act like tiny
cosmic meteorological stations</text><text start="273.09" dur="2.993">and monitor the evolution
of these space storms.</text><text start="276.979" dur="5.335">So I, with a group of researchers,
gather and analyze this data</text><text start="282.338" dur="3.049">coming from different
locations of the Solar System.</text><text start="285.411" dur="3.316">And by doing so, my research
shows that, actually,</text><text start="288.751" dur="2.088">solar storms have a generic shape,</text><text start="290.863" dur="4.505">and that this shape evolves
as solar storms move away from the Sun.</text><text start="295.392" dur="1.155">And you know what?</text><text start="296.571" dur="5.333">This is key for building tools
to predict space weather.</text><text start="303.42" dur="3.085">I would like to leave you
with this beautiful image.</text><text start="306.529" dur="2.409">This is us here on Earth,</text><text start="309.692" dur="1.317">this pale blue dot.</text><text start="311.736" dur="3.664">And while I study the Sun
and its storms every day,</text><text start="315.424" dur="3.926">I will always have a deep love
for this beautiful planet --</text><text start="320.076" dur="1.391">a pale blue dot indeed,</text><text start="321.491" dur="3.884">but a pale blue dot
with an invisible magnetic shield</text><text start="325.399" dur="2.206">that helps to protect us.</text><text start="327.629" dur="1.306">Thank you.</text><text start="328.959" dur="3.341">(Applause)</text></transcript>
