<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="12.916" dur="2.346">The Philippines: an idyllic country</text><text start="15.286" dur="3.753">with some of the clearest water
and bluest skies on the planet.</text><text start="19.063" dur="1.592">It is also the epicenter</text><text start="20.679" dur="3.401">of one of the fastest-growing
HIV epidemics in the world.</text><text start="24.494" dur="3.808">On the surface, it seems
as if we are just a late bloomer.</text><text start="28.326" dur="2.843">However, the reasons
for our current epidemic</text><text start="31.193" dur="1.824">are much more complicated</text><text start="33.041" dur="3.921">and may foreshadow
a global resurgence of HIV.</text><text start="38.128" dur="4.481">While overall new cases of HIV
continue to drop in the world,</text><text start="42.633" dur="2.46">this trend may be short-lived</text><text start="45.117" dur="3.885">when the next wave of more aggressive
and resistant viruses arrive.</text><text start="49.601" dur="5.822">HIV has a potential to transform itself
into a new and different virus</text><text start="55.447" dur="1.555">every time it infects a cell.</text><text start="57.7" dur="4.063">Despite the remarkable progress
we&amp;#39;ve made in reversing the epidemic,</text><text start="61.787" dur="4.814">the truth is that we are just a few
viral mutations away from disaster.</text><text start="67.125" dur="3.979">To appreciate the profound way
in which HIV transforms itself</text><text start="71.128" dur="1.673">every time it reproduces,</text><text start="72.825" dur="1.748">let&amp;#39;s make a genetic comparison.</text><text start="75.161" dur="3.595">If we look at the DNA variation
among humans of different races</text><text start="78.78" dur="1.613">from different continents,</text><text start="80.417" dur="3.496">the actual DNA difference
is only 0.1 percent.</text><text start="84.469" dur="2.094">If we look at the genetic difference</text><text start="86.587" dur="4.134">between humans, great apes,
and rhesus macaques,</text><text start="90.745" dur="1.929">that number is seven percent.</text><text start="93.348" dur="4.111">In contrast, the genetic difference
between HIV subtypes</text><text start="97.483" dur="1.575">from different patients</text><text start="99.082" dur="2.473">may be as much as 35 percent.</text><text start="102.094" dur="2.747">Within a person infected with HIV,</text><text start="104.865" dur="3.396">the genetic difference
between an infecting mother virus</text><text start="108.285" dur="2.325">and subsequent daughter viruses</text><text start="110.634" dur="2.387">has been shown to be
as much as five percent.</text><text start="113.376" dur="4.643">This is the equivalent of a gorilla
giving birth to a chimpanzee,</text><text start="118.043" dur="1.828">then to an orangutan,</text><text start="119.895" dur="1.559">then to a baboon,</text><text start="121.478" dur="2.873">then to any random great ape
within its lifetime.</text><text start="124.375" dur="3.941">There are nearly 100 subtypes of HIV,</text><text start="128.34" dur="2.469">with new subtypes
being discovered regularly.</text><text start="131.448" dur="5.312">HIV in the developed world
is almost all of one subtype:</text><text start="136.784" dur="1.153">subtype B.</text><text start="138.85" dur="3.85">Mostly everything we know
and do to treat HIV</text><text start="142.724" dur="3.557">is based on studies on subtype B,</text><text start="146.305" dur="2.638">even though it only
accounts for 12 percent</text><text start="148.967" dur="3.484">of the total number
of cases of HIV in the world.</text><text start="153.182" dur="2.611">But because of the profound
genetic difference</text><text start="155.817" dur="2.35">among different subtypes,</text><text start="158.191" dur="3.437">some subtypes are more likely
to become drug-resistant</text><text start="162.168" dur="2.024">or progress to AIDS faster.</text><text start="164.763" dur="4.722">We discovered that the explosion
of HIV cases in the Philippines</text><text start="169.509" dur="4.232">is due to a shift
from the Western subtype B</text><text start="173.765" dur="4.631">to a more aggressive
Southeast Asian subtype AE.</text><text start="178.794" dur="2.731">We are seeing younger and sicker patients</text><text start="181.549" dur="1.98">with high rates of drug resistance.</text><text start="184.195" dur="2.873">Initial encroachment of this subtype</text><text start="187.092" dur="2.711">is already occurring
in developed countries,</text><text start="189.827" dur="3.74">including Australia,
Canada and the United States.</text><text start="193.591" dur="4.504">We may soon see a similar
explosion of cases in these countries.</text><text start="199.393" dur="3.005">And while we think that HIV is done</text><text start="202.422" dur="1.998">and that the tide has turned for it,</text><text start="204.444" dur="2.966">just like with real tides,
it can come right back.</text><text start="207.834" dur="3.436">In the early 1960s,
malaria was on the ropes.</text><text start="211.294" dur="1.995">As the number of cases dropped,</text><text start="213.313" dur="2.769">people and governments
stopped paying attention.</text><text start="216.106" dur="4.754">The result was a deadly resurgence
of drug-resistant malaria.</text><text start="221.562" dur="1.688">We need to think of HIV</text><text start="223.274" dur="3.697">not as a single virus
that we think we&amp;#39;ve figured out,</text><text start="226.995" dur="6.194">but as a collection of rapidly evolving
and highly unique viruses,</text><text start="233.213" dur="2.78">each of which can set off
the next deadly epidemic.</text><text start="236.474" dur="3.536">We are incorporating
more powerful and new tools</text><text start="240.034" dur="3.135">to help us detect
the next deadly HIV strain,</text><text start="243.193" dur="4.028">and this needs to go hand in hand
with urgent research</text><text start="247.245" dur="4.472">on the behavior and proper treatment
of non-B subtypes.</text><text start="252.201" dur="1.81">We need to convince our governments</text><text start="254.035" dur="1.65">and our funding agencies</text><text start="255.709" dur="3.298">that HIV is not yet done.</text><text start="260.357" dur="4.09">Over 35 million people have died of HIV.</text><text start="265.098" dur="3.41">We are on the verge
of an AIDS-free generation.</text><text start="268.532" dur="2.193">We need to pay attention.</text><text start="270.749" dur="2.333">We need to remain vigilant</text><text start="273.106" dur="1.497">and follow through.</text><text start="274.627" dur="2.903">Otherwise, millions more will die.</text><text start="277.554" dur="1.199">Thank you.</text><text start="278.777" dur="4.414">(Applause)</text></transcript>
