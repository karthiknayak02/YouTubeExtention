dur="2.27">to drive home the value of a tactic like this</text><text start="164.2" dur="2.25">I want to share with you a very famous example</text><text start="166.91" dur="2.36">where analogies with

dur="4.96">The hope though, is that what I show you here helps to make that phenomenon more intuitive</text><text start="181.64" dur="3.46">The focus throughout will be on higher-dimensional spheres.</text><text start="185.4" dur="2.62">For example, when we talk about a four-dimensional sphere</text><text start="188.2" dur="2.52">Say, with radius 1, centered at the origin.</text><text start="191.02" dur="4.4">What that actually is is the set of all quadruplets of numbers</text><text start="195.48" dur="3.86">x, y, z, w, where the sum of the squares of these numbers is 1.</text><text start="199.97" dur="2.809">What I have pictured here now is multiple</text><text start="203.36" dur="2.449">three-dimensional slices of a 4D sphere</text><text start="206.39" dur="2">projected back into three dimensions</text><text start="208.84" dur="1.74">but it&amp;#39;s confusing and</text><text start="210.6" dur="2">even if you do wrap your head around it,</text><text start="212.6" dur="2.42">it just pushes the question back, to how you would think</text><text start="215.04" dur="2.98">about a 5- or a 6- or a 7-dimensional sphere</text><text start="218.02" dur="4.38">and more importantly squinting your eyes to understand a projection like this</text><text start="222.44" dur="5.24">is not very reflective of what doing math with a 4D sphere actually entails.</text><text start="228.83" dur="5.509">Instead, the basic idea here will be to get very literal about it and to think about four separate numbers</text><text start="234.34" dur="5.92">I like to picture for vertical number lines with sliders to represent each number.</text><text start="240.34" dur="5.7">Each configuration of these sliders is a point in 4D space: A quadruplet of numbers.</text><text start="246.16" dur="4.54">And what it means to be on a 4D unit sphere centered at the origin,</text><text start="250.76" dur="3.44">is that the sum of the squares of these four values is 1.</text><text start="256.48" dur="7.04">Our goal is to understand which movements of these sliders correspond to movements on the sphere.</text><text start="265.2" dur="5">To do that, it helps if we knock things down to two dimensions where we can actually see the circle.</text><text start="270.3" dur="0.9">So ask yourself,</text><text start="271.38" dur="5.14">What&amp;#39;s a nice way to think about this relation that x²+y² is 1?</text><text start="277.6" dur="4.94">Well, I like to think of the value of x² as the real estate belonging to x,</text><text start="282.54" dur="4.06">and likewise the value of y² is the real estate belonging to y,</text><text start="286.6" dur="3.94">and that they have a total of 1 unit of real estate to share between them.</text><text start="291.13" dur="2.299">So moving around on the circle</text><text start="293.98" dur="3.979">Corresponds to a constant exchange of real estate between the two variables</text><text start="299.169" dur="3.17">Part of the reason I choose this term is that it lets us make a very useful</text><text start="302.44" dur="5.239">Analogy: That real estate is cheap near zero, and more expensive away from zero.</text><text start="308.26" dur="4.849">To see this, consider starting off in a position where x=1 and y is zero.</text><text start="313.33" dur="2.63">Meaning x has all of the real estate to itself</text><text start="316.24" dur="4.369">which in our usual geometric picture means we&amp;#39;re on the right most point of the circle.</text><text start="320.95" dur="4.609">If you move x down just a bit to 0.9 the value of x²</text><text start="325.93" dur="6.559">changes to 0.81, so it has in effect given up 0.19 units of real estate</text><text start="332.95" dur="2.869">But for y² to increase by that same amount</text><text start="336.4" dur="6.619">Y has to move an entire 0.44 units away from zero more than four times the amount that x moved</text><text start="343.479" dur="4.04">in other words, X changed a little to give up expensive real estate,</text><text start="347.59" dur="4.399">So that y could move a lot and gain the same value of cheap real estate.</text><text start="352.63" dur="5.149">In terms of the usual circle drawing this corresponds to the steep slope near the right side.</text><text start="358" dur="3.44">A small nudge in x allows for a very big change to y</text><text start="362.53" dur="3.559">Moving forward, let&amp;#39;s add some tick marks to these lines to indicate</text><text start="366.78" dur="3.08">what 0.05 units of real estate looks like at each point</text><text start="370.12" dur="6.62">that is how much would x have to change so that the value of x² changes by 0.05</text><text start="377.22" dur="4.9">As you walk around the circle the trade-off in value between x² and y²</text><text start="382.12" dur="5.66">gives this piston looking dance motion, where the sliders are moving more slowly away from 0</text><text start="388.24" dur="3.16">Because real estate is more expensive in those regions.</text><text start="391.48" dur="2.32">There are just more tick marks to cover per unit distance</text><text start="394.94" dur="7.74">Also, a nice side effect of the term real estate is that it aligns naturally with the fact that it comes in units of distance squared.</text><text start="402.74" dur="6.4">So the square root of the total real estate among all coordinates gives us the distance from the origin.</text><text start="410.24" dur="5.96">For a unit sphere in 3 dimensions the set of all triplets x,y,z, where the sum of their squares is 1</text><text start="416.4" dur="3.17">All we have to do is add a third slider for z</text><text start="419.94" dur="4.36">But these three sliders still only have the one unit of real estate to share between them</text><text start="424.76" dur="4.02">To get a feel for this imagine holding x in place at 0.5,</text><text start="428.94" dur="3.76">where it occupies 0.25 units of real Estate</text><text start="433.08" dur="2.66">What this means, is that y and z can move around</text><text start="435.76" dur="2.66">in the same piston dance motion we saw before</text><text start="438.44" dur="4.22">as they trade off the remaining 0.75 units of real Estate.</text><text start="443.22" dur="3">In terms of our typical way of visualizing a sphere,</text><text start="446.22" dur="5.1">this corresponds to slicing the sphere along the plane where x is 0.5</text><text start="451.52" dur="4.94">and looking at the circle formed by all of the choices for Y and Z on that sphere.</text><text start="457.47" dur="5.839">As you increase the value of x the amount of real estate left over for Y and Z is smaller</text><text start="463.44" dur="5.059">And this more constrained piston dance is what it feels like for the circular slice to be smaller</text><text start="469.29" dur="2.479">eventually once x reaches the value 1</text><text start="471.9" dur="6.23">there&amp;#39;s no real estate left over, so you reach this singularity point where y and z are both forced to be 0</text><text start="479.25" dur="3.589">The feeling here is a bit like being a bug on the surface of the sphere</text><text start="483.33" dur="3.349">You are unable to see the whole sphere all at once instead</text><text start="487.11" dur="4.82">You&amp;#39;re just sitting on a single point, and you have some sense for what local movements are allowed</text><text start="495.85" dur="4.91">In 4 dimensions and higher we lose the crutch of the global view that a spatial visual offers</text><text start="500.95" dur="3.92">But the fundamental rules of this real estate exchange remain the same</text><text start="505.27" dur="3.92">If you fix one slider in place and watch the other three trade off</text><text start="509.62" dur="6.199">This is basically what it means to take a slice of the 4D sphere to get a small 3D sphere in</text><text start="515.92" dur="3.469">Much the same way that fixing one of the sliders for the three dimensional case</text><text start="519.73" dur="3.44">Give us a circular slice when the remaining two were free to vary</text><text start="524.8" dur="5.239">Now watching these sliders move about and thinking about the real estate exchange is pretty fun</text><text start="530.35" dur="5.75">but it runs the risk of being aimless unless we have an actual high dimensional puzzle to sink our teeth into</text><text start="536.71" dur="6.619">so let&amp;#39;s set aside the sliders for just a moment and bring in a very classic example of something that seems reasonable and</text><text start="543.52" dur="2.44">even dull in two and three dimensions</text><text start="546.12" dur="3.24">But which is totally out of whack in higher dimensions.</text><text start="550.66" dur="3.02">To start, take a 2x2 box centered at the origin</text><text start="554.41" dur="6.08">Its corners around the vertices (1, 1), (1, -1),  (-1, 1) and (-1, -1).</text><text start="561.31" dur="2.869">Draw four circles each with radius one centered</text><text start="564.82" dur="4.64">At these four vertices so each one is tangent to two of its neighbors</text><text start="570.12" dur="6.62">Now I want you to think of the circle centered at the origin which is just large enough to be touching those corner circles</text><text start="576.94" dur="2.06">Tangent to each one of them</text><text start="579.01" dur="6.77">What we want to do for this setup and for its analogies in higher dimensions is find the radius of that inner circle</text><text start="587.56" dur="1.1">Here in two dimensions</text><text start="588.66" dur="3.119">We can use the pythagorean theorem to see that the distance from the origin</text><text start="592.24" dur="5.119">To the corner of the box is the square root of two which is around 1.414</text><text start="597.91" dur="5.9">Then you can subtract off this portion here, the radius of the corner circle, which by definition is 1</text><text start="604.21" dur="6.5">And that means the radius of the inner circle is square root of 2 minus 1 or about 0.414</text><text start="611.11" dur="2.419">No surprises here, that seems pretty reasonable.</text><text start="614.59" dur="2.91">Now do something analogous in three dimensions:</text><text start="617.5" dur="2.03">draw a 2 x 2 x 2 cube.</text><text start="619.72" dur="4.19">Whose corners have vertices (1, 1, 1), (1, 1, -1), on and on and on.</text><text start="624.719" dur="5.81">and then we&amp;#39;re gonna take eight different spheres each of which has a radius one and</text><text start="630.929" dur="5.119">Center them on these vertices so that each one is tangent to three of its neighbors</text><text start="636.779" dur="7.549">Now again think about the sphere centered at the origin which is just large enough to be barely touching those eight corner spheres</text><text start="644.669" dur="5.239">As before, we can start by thinking about the distance from the origin to the corner of the box</text><text start="650.069" dur="2">say the corner at (1, 1, 1)</text><text start="653.249" dur="0.71">By the way</text><text start="653.959" dur="4.679">I guess I still haven&amp;#39;t yet explicitly said that the way distances work in higher dimensions is</text><text start="658.979" dur="5.299">Always to add up the squares of the components in each direction and take the square root</text><text start="664.679" dur="5.179">If you&amp;#39;ve never seen why this follows from the pythagorean theorem just in the two-dimensional case</text><text start="670.019" dur="5.899">it&amp;#39;s actually a really fun puzzle to think about and I&amp;#39;ve left the relevant image up on the screen for any of you who want</text><text start="675.919" dur="1.93">want to pause and ponder on it.</text><text start="677.849" dur="4.85">Anyway, in our case the distance between the origin and the corner (1, 1, 1) is the</text><text start="682.919" dur="5.929">Square root of 1²+1²+1² or square root of 3, which is about 1.73</text><text start="689.46" dur="3.52">So the radius of that inner sphere is going to be this quantity</text><text start="693.48" dur="4.5">Minus the radius of a corner sphere, which by definition is 1.</text><text start="698.06" dur="5.78">And again, 0.73 seems like a reasonable radius for that inner sphere.</text><text start="703.84" dur="3.2">But what happens to that inner radius as you increase dimensions?</text><text start="707.999" dur="3.681">Obviously the reason I bring this up. Is that something surprising will happen,</text><text start="711.68" dur="2.1">and some of you might see where this is going.</text><text start="713.88" dur="3.24">But actually don&amp;#39;t want it to feel like a surprise -</text><text start="717.12" dur="3.32">as fun as it is to wow people with counterintuitive facts in math</text><text start="720.689" dur="3.049">The goal here is genuine understanding, not shock</text><text start="724.109" dur="4.58">For higher dimensions we&amp;#39;ll be using sliders to get a gut feel for what&amp;#39;s going on</text><text start="728.789" dur="5.54">But since it&amp;#39;s kind of a different way of viewing things it helps to get a running start by looking back at how to analyze</text><text start="734.329" dur="3.329">the two and three-dimensional cases in the context of sliders</text><text start="738.72" dur="1.46">First things first,</text><text start="740.18" dur="3.929">how do you think about a circle centered at a corner, like (1, -1)?</text><text start="744.689" dur="2.659">Well previously for a circle centered at the origin</text><text start="747.929" dur="6.08">the amount of real estate belonging to both x and y was dependent on their distance from the number 0</text><text start="754.7" dur="3.33">And it&amp;#39;s the same basic idea here as you move around the center</text><text start="758.03" dur="4.95">It&amp;#39;s just that the real estate might be dependent on the distance between each coordinate and some other number</text><text start="763.23" dur="2.779">so for this circle centered at (1, -1)</text><text start="766.38" dur="5.03">the amount of real estate belonging to x is the square of its distance from 1</text><text start="772.08" dur="5.239">Likewise the real estate belonging to y is the square of its distance from negative 1</text><text start="777.72" dur="4.489">Other than that the looking feel with this piston dance trade-off is completely the same</text><text start="783.27" dur="4.459">for simplicity we&amp;#39;ll only focus on one of these circles the one centered at (1, 1)</text><text start="788.4" dur="0.96">Now ask yourself</text><text start="789.36" dur="2.63">What does it mean to find a circle centered at the origin?</text><text start="792.48" dur="4.22">Large enough to be tangent to this guy when we&amp;#39;re thinking just in terms of sliders</text><text start="800.01" dur="5.27">Well, notice how this point of tangency happens when the x and y coordinates are both the same</text><text start="805.5" dur="5.03">Or phrased differently, at the point of this corner circle closest to the origin</text><text start="811.08" dur="3.169">The real estate is shared evenly between x and y</text><text start="815.01" dur="3.859">This will be important for later. So let&amp;#39;s really dig in and think about why it&amp;#39;s true</text><text start="819.96" dur="2.24">Imagine perturbing that point slightly.</text><text start="822.2" dur="4.919">Maybe moving x a little closer to 0 which means y would have to move a little away from 0</text><text start="827.61" dur="3.65">The change in x would have to be a little smaller than the change in y</text><text start="831.51" dur="5.809">Since the real estate it gains by moving farther away from 1 is more expensive than the real estate that y</text><text start="837.42" dur="2">loses by getting closer to 1</text><text start="839.85" dur="5.17">But from the perspective of the origin point (0, 0) that trade-off is reversed.</text><text start="845.02" dur="2.78">The resulting change to x² is</text><text start="847.86" dur="6.8">smaller than the resulting change to y² since when real estate is measured with respect to (0, 0)</text><text start="855.06" dur="3.65">That move of y towards 1 is the more expensive one</text><text start="859.86" dur="2.76">What this means is that any slight perturbation</text><text start="862.8" dur="5.96">Away from this point where real estate is shared evenly results in an increasing distance from the origin</text><text start="869.97" dur="1.01">The reason we care</text><text start="870.98" dur="2.58">Is that this point is tangent to the inner circle</text><text start="873.78" dur="3.469">So we can also think about it as being a point of the inner circle</text><text start="877.249" dur="7.011">And this will be very useful for higher dimensions. It gives us a reference point to understanding the radius of that inner circle</text><text start="885.24" dur="5.78">Specifically you can ask how much real estate is shared between x and y at this point</text><text start="891.02" dur="3.64">when real estatemeasurements are done with respect to the origin (0, 0)</text><text start="895.62" dur="2.58">For example down here in two dimensions</text><text start="898.28" dur="4.46">both x and y dip below 0.5 in this configuration</text><text start="903.02" dur="7.52">So the total value x²+y² is going to be less than 0.5²+0.5²</text><text start="911.55" dur="5.45">Comparing to this halfway point is really going to come in handy for wrapping our mind around what happens in higher dimensions</text><text start="917.64" dur="2.959">Taking things one step at a time, let&amp;#39;s bump it up to three dimensions</text><text start="922.5" dur="4.42">Consider the corner sphere with radius 1 centered at (1, 1, 1).</text><text start="926.92" dur="3.3">The point on that sphere that&amp;#39;s closest to the origin</text><text start="930.42" dur="6.94">Corresponds to the configuration of sliders where x, y and z are all reaching down toward 0 and equal to each other</text><text start="938.12" dur="5.92">Again, they all have to go a little beyond that halfway point because the position 0.5</text><text start="944.08" dur="5.6">only accounts for 0.5² (or 0.25) units of real estate</text><text start="950.24" dur="5.78">so with all three coordinates getting 1/3 of a unit of real estate they need to be farther out.</text><text start="956.52" dur="4.252">And again, since this is a point where the corner sphere is tangent to the inner sphere,</text><text start="960.78" dur="2.1">it&amp;#39;s also a point of the inner sphere.</text><text start="963.2" dur="3.72">so with reference to the origin (0, 0, 0)</text><text start="967.1" dur="6.9">Think about the amount of real estate shared between x, y, and z in this position corresponding to the tangent point</text><text start="974.7" dur="2.479">It&amp;#39;s definitely less than 0.75</text><text start="977.76" dur="3.289">Since all three of these are smaller than 0.5</text><text start="981.66" dur="4.459">so each one has less than 0.25 units of real estate and</text><text start="986.7" dur="3.32">Again, we sit back and feel comfortable with this result, right?</text><text start="990.02" dur="2.459">The inner sphere is smaller than the corner spheres</text><text start="993.21" dur="2.989">But things get interesting when we move up into four dimensions</text><text start="997.56" dur="5.04">Our 2x2x2x2 box is going to have 16 vertices</text><text start="1002.82" dur="4.36">at (1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1, -1) and so on,</text><text start="1007.18" dur="3.84">with all possible binary combinations of 1 and -1</text><text start="1011.899" dur="4.961">What this means, is that there are 16 units spheres centered at these corners,</text><text start="1016.86" dur="1.959">each one tangent to four of its neighbours</text><text start="1019.67" dur="2.69">As before, we&amp;#39;ll just be focusing on one of them,</text><text start="1022.36" dur="1.8">the one centered at (1,1,1,1).</text><text start="1025" dur="2.08">the point of the sphere closest to the origin</text><text start="1027.77" dur="7.28">Corresponds to the configuration of sliders where all four coordinates reach exactly halfway between 1 and 0.</text><text start="1035.5" dur="4.64">And that&amp;#39;s because when one of the coordinates is 0.5 units away from 1</text><text start="1040.14" dur="4.32">it has 0.25 units of real estate with respect to the point 1.</text><text start="1045.02" dur="1.59">We do the same trick as before</text><text start="1046.61" dur="4.43">Thinking of this now as a point of the inner sphere and measuring things with respect to the origin</text><text start="1051.5" dur="3.52">But you can already see what&amp;#39;s cool about four dimensions:</text><text start="1055.02" dur="3.88">as you switch to thinking of real estate with respect to (0, 0, 0, 0)</text><text start="1059.42" dur="5.509">It&amp;#39;s still the case that each of these four coordinates has 0.25 units of real estate</text><text start="1065.42" dur="3.139">Making for a total of 1 shared between the four coordinates</text><text start="1069.679" dur="4.94">In other words that inner sphere is precisely the same size as the corner spheres</text><text start="1075.23" dur="2.699">This matches with what you see numerically by the way</text><text start="1077.929" dur="6.35">where you can compute the distance between the origin and the corner (1,1,1,1) is the square root of four,</text><text start="1084.47" dur="4.969">And then when you subtract off the radius of one of the corners spheres what you get is 1.</text><text start="1090.02" dur="6.079">But there&amp;#39;s something much more satisfying about seeing it, rather than just computing it in particular</text><text start="1096.1" dur="3.329">Here&amp;#39;s a cool aspect of the fact that that inner sphere has radius one</text><text start="1099.86" dur="3.89">move things around so that all of the real estate goes to the coordinate x and</text><text start="1103.88" dur="2.719">You&amp;#39;ll end up at the point (1,0,0,0).</text><text start="1107.15" dur="4.4">this point is actually touching the 2x2x2x2 box.</text><text start="1112.04" dur="3.36">And when you&amp;#39;re stuck thinking in the two or three dimensional cases,</text><text start="1115.4" dur="2.719">this fact, that the inner sphere has radius one,</text><text start="1118.16" dur="4.009">The same size as the corner spheres and that it touches the box</text><text start="1122.929" dur="2">Well it just seems too big</text><text start="1124.97" dur="7.91">But it&amp;#39;s important to realize this is fundamentally a four dimensional phenomenon, and you just can&amp;#39;t cram it down into smaller dimensions</text><text start="1133.81" dur="3.57">But things get weirder. Let&amp;#39;s knock it up to five dimensions.</text><text start="1137.38" dur="1.68">In this case, we have quite a few corner spheres:</text><text start="1139.06" dur="2.02">32 in total.</text><text start="1141.08" dur="4.219">But again, for simplicity, we&amp;#39;ll only be thinking about the one centered at (1, 1, 1, 1, 1)</text><text start="1146.18" dur="7.38">Think about the point of the sphere closest to the origin where all five coordinates are equally splitting the one unit of shared real-estate</text><text start="1154.1" dur="4.38">This time, each coordinate is a little higher than 0.5</text><text start="1158.48" dur="1.94">if they reach down to 0.5</text><text start="1160.42" dur="6.28">Each one would have .25 units of real estate giving a total of 1.25 which is too much?</text><text start="1167.51" dur="3.98">But, the tables are turned when you view this as a point on the inner sphere</text><text start="1172.22" dur="5.239">Because with respect to the origin this configuration has much more than one unit of real estate</text><text start="1179.84" dur="4.01">Not only is every coordinate more than .5 units away from zero</text><text start="1184.13" dur="5.27">But the larger number of dimensions means that there&amp;#39;s more total real estate when you add it all up</text><text start="1190.64" dur="5.03">specifically you can compute that the radius of that inner sphere is about 1.24</text><text start="1196.22" dur="2.44">The intuitive feel for what that means,</text><text start="1198.76" dur="5.7">is that the sliders can roam over more territory than what just a single unit of real estate would allow</text><text start="1205.19" dur="5.719">One fun way to see what this means is to adjust everything so that all of the real estate goes to just one coordinate</text><text start="1211.7" dur="6.109">Because this coordinate can reach beyond 1, what you are seeing is that this five dimensional inner sphere</text><text start="1218.45" dur="2.15">Actually pokes outside the box</text><text start="1222.41" dur="5.719">But to really get a feel for how strange things become as a last example. I want to jump up into ten dimensions</text><text start="1228.92" dur="5.359">remember, all this means is that points have ten coordinates for a sphere with radius one a</text><text start="1234.59" dur="4.039">Single unit of real estate must be shared among all ten of those coordinates</text><text start="1239.15" dur="7.7">as always the point of this corner sphere closest to the origin is the one where all ten coordinates split the real estate evenly and</text><text start="1247.22" dur="4.189">here you can really see just how far away this feels from the origin or</text><text start="1251.9" dur="6.22">phrased differently, that inner sphere is allowed to have a very large amount of real estate.</text><text start="1258.5" dur="5.52">In fact, you can compute that the radius of the inner sphere is about 2.16</text><text start="1264.56" dur="1.5">and viewed from this perspective,</text><text start="1266.06" dur="3.54">where you have tenfold the mentions to share that real estate</text><text start="1269.94" dur="7.56">Doesn&amp;#39;t it actually feel somewhat reasonable that the inner sphere should have a radius more than twice as big as all those corner spheres?</text><text start="1278.399" dur="3.341">To get a sense for just how big this inner sphere is,</text><text start="1281.74" dur="3.099">look back in two dimensions and imagine a 4x4 box</text><text start="1285.36" dur="2.419">bounding all four circles from the outside</text><text start="1288.33" dur="3.65">Or go to three dimensions, and imagine a 4x4x4 box</text><text start="1292.499" dur="3.08">bounding all of those corner spheres from the outside</text><text start="1296.19" dur="6.199">Way up here in ten dimensions, that &amp;quot;inner sphere&amp;quot;
