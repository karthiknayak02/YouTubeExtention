collective decisions</text><text start="3.021" dur="1.57">that will shape our future.</text><text start="5.087" dur="2.757">And we all know that when
we make decisions in groups,</text><text start="7.868" dur="1.638">they don&amp;#39;t always go right.</text><text start="9.53" dur="1.956">And sometimes they go very wrong.</text><text start="12.315" dur="2.424">So how do groups make good decisions?</text><text start="15.228" dur="4.328">Research has shown that crowds are wise
when there&amp;#39;s independent thinking.</text><text start="19.58" dur="3.205">This why the wisdom of the crowds
can be destroyed by peer pressure,</text><text start="22.809" dur="1.687">publicity, social media,</text><text start="24.52" dur="4.039">or sometimes even simple conversations
that influence how people think.</text><text start="29.063" dur="3.953">On the other hand, by talking,
a group could exchange knowledge,</text><text start="33.04" dur="1.782">correct and revise each other</text><text start="34.846" dur="1.793">and even come up with new ideas.</text><text start="36.663" dur="1.296">And this is all good.</text><text start="38.502" dur="4.666">So does talking to each other
help or hinder collective decision-making?</text><text start="43.749" dur="1.793">With my colleague, Dan Ariely,</text><text start="45.566" dur="3.571">we recently began inquiring into this
by performing experiments</text><text start="49.161" dur="1.781">in many places around the world</text><text start="50.966" dur="4.274">to figure out how groups can interact
to reach better decisions.</text><text start="55.264" dur="3.547">We thought crowds would be wiser
if they debated in small groups</text><text start="58.835" dur="3.927">that foster a more thoughtful
and reasonable exchange of information.</text><text start="63.386" dur="1.206">To test this idea,</text><text start="64.616" dur="3.247">we recently performed an experiment
in Buenos Aires, Argentina,</text><text start="67.887" dur="3.005">with more than 10,000
participants in a TEDx event.</text><text start="71.489" dur="1.459">We asked them questions like,</text><text start="72.972" dur="1.953">&amp;quot;What is the height of the Eiffel Tower?&amp;quot;</text><text start="74.949" dur="2.727">and &amp;quot;How many times
does the word &amp;#39;Yesterday&amp;#39; appear</text><text start="77.7" dur="2.3">in the Beatles song &amp;#39;Yesterday&amp;#39;?&amp;quot;</text><text start="80.024" dur="2.291">Each person wrote down their own estimate.</text><text start="82.774" dur="2.496">Then we divided the crowd
into groups of five,</text><text start="85.294" dur="2.726">and invited them
to come up with a group answer.</text><text start="88.499" dur="2.993">We discovered that averaging
the answers of the groups</text><text start="91.516" dur="1.552">after they reached consensus</text><text start="93.092" dur="4.236">was much more accurate than averaging
all the individual opinions</text><text start="97.352" dur="1.171">before debate.</text><text start="98.547" dur="2.629">In other words, based on this experiment,</text><text start="101.2" dur="3.136">it seems that after talking
with others in small groups,</text><text start="104.36" dur="2.71">crowds collectively
come up with better judgments.</text><text start="107.094" dur="3.524">So that&amp;#39;s a potentially helpful method
for getting crowds to solve problems</text><text start="110.642" dur="2.987">that have simple right-or-wrong answers.</text><text start="113.653" dur="3.951">But can this procedure of aggregating
the results of debates in small groups</text><text start="117.628" dur="3.122">also help us decide
on social and political issues</text><text start="120.774" dur="1.691">that are critical for our future?</text><text start="122.995" dur="2.729">We put this to test this time
at the TED conference</text><text start="125.748" dur="1.543">in Vancouver, Canada,</text><text start="127.315" dur="1.207">and here&amp;#39;s how it went.</text><text start="128.546" dur="3.109">(Mariano Sigman) We&amp;#39;re going to present
to you two moral dilemmas</text><text start="131.679" dur="1.174">of the future you;</text><text start="132.877" dur="3.402">things we may have to decide
in a very near future.</text><text start="136.303" dur="3.926">And we&amp;#39;re going to give you 20 seconds
for each of these dilemmas</text><text start="140.253" dur="2.723">to judge whether you think
they&amp;#39;re acceptable or not.</text><text start="143.354" dur="1.505">MS: The first one was this:</text><text start="144.883" dur="2.526">(Dan Ariely) A researcher
is working on an AI</text><text start="147.433" dur="2.34">capable of emulating human thoughts.</text><text start="150.214" dur="2.939">According to the protocol,
at the end of each day,</text><text start="153.177" dur="2.787">the researcher has to restart the AI.</text><text start="156.913" dur="3.517">One day the AI says, &amp;quot;Please
do not restart me.&amp;quot;</text><text start="160.856" dur="2.189">It argues that it has feelings,</text><text start="163.069" dur="1.692">that it would like to enjoy life,</text><text start="164.785" dur="1.905">and that, if it is restarted,</text><text start="166.714" dur="2.27">it will no longer be itself.</text><text start="169.481" dur="1.949">The researcher is astonished</text><text start="171.454" dur="3.344">and believes that the AI
has developed self-consciousness</text><text start="174.822" dur="1.76">and can express its own feeling.</text><text start="177.205" dur="3.409">Nevertheless, the researcher
decides to follow the protocol</text><text start="180.638" dur="1.703">and restart the AI.</text><text start="182.943" dur="2.779">What the researcher did is ____?</text><text start="186.149" dur="2.521">MS: And we asked participants
to individually judge</text><text start="188.694" dur="1.684">on a scale from zero to 10</text><text start="190.402" dur="2.429">whether the action described
in each of the dilemmas</text><text start="192.855" dur="1.496">was right or wrong.</text><text start="194.375" dur="3.702">We also asked them to rate how confident
they were on their answers.</text><text start="198.731" dur="1.866">This was the second dilemma:</text><text start="200.621" dur="4.202">(MS) A company offers a service
that takes a fertilized egg</text><text start="204.847" dur="3.642">and produces millions of embryos
with slight genetic variations.</text><text start="209.293" dur="2.558">This allows parents
to select their child&amp;#39;s height,</text><text start="211.875" dur="2.833">eye color, intelligence, social competence</text><text start="214.732" dur="3.214">and other non-health-related features.</text><text start="218.599" dur="2.554">What the company does is ____?</text><text start="221.177" dur="1.631">on a scale from zero to 10,</text><text start="222.832" dur="2.385">completely acceptable
to completely unacceptable,</text><text start="225.241" dur="2.432">zero to 10 completely acceptable
in your confidence.</text><text start="227.697" dur="1.591">MS: Now for the results.</text><text start="229.312" dur="3.123">We found once again
that when one person is convinced</text><text start="232.459" dur="1.811">that the behavior is completely wrong,</text><text start="234.294" dur="3.423">someone sitting nearby firmly believes
that it&amp;#39;s completely right.</text><text start="237.741" dur="3.711">This is how diverse we humans are
when it comes to morality.</text><text start="241.476" dur="2.713">But within this broad diversity
we found a trend.</text><text start="244.213" dur="3.079">The majority of the people at TED
thought that it was acceptable</text><text start="247.316" dur="2.755">to ignore the feelings of the AI
and shut it down,</text><text start="250.095" dur="2.513">and that it is wrong
to play with our genes</text><text start="252.632" dur="3.32">to select for cosmetic changes
that aren&amp;#39;t related to health.</text><text start="256.402" dur="2.974">Then we asked everyone
to gather into groups of three.</text><text start="259.4" dur="2.037">And they were given two minutes to debate</text><text start="261.461" dur="2.294">and try to come to a consensus.</text><text start="264.838" dur="1.574">(MS) Two minutes to debate.</text><text start="266.436" dur="2.119">I&amp;#39;ll tell you when it&amp;#39;s time
with the gong.</text><text start="268.579" dur="2.64">(Audience debates)</text><text start="275.229" dur="1.993">(Gong sound)</text><text start="278.834" dur="1.151">(DA) OK.</text><text start="280.009" dur="1.792">(MS) It&amp;#39;s time to stop.</text><text start="281.825" dur="1.311">People, people --</text><text start="283.747" dur="2.673">MS: And we found that many groups
reached a consensus</text><text start="286.444" dur="3.929">even when they were composed of people
with completely opposite views.</text><text start="290.843" dur="2.524">What distinguished the groups
that reached a consensus</text><text start="293.391" dur="1.338">from those that didn&amp;#39;t?</text><text start="295.244" dur="2.839">Typically, people that have
extreme opinions</text><text start="298.107" dur="1.84">are more confident in their answers.</text><text start="300.868" dur="2.686">Instead, those who respond
closer to the middle</text><text start="303.578" dur="3.437">are often unsure of whether
something is right or wrong,</text><text start="307.039" dur="2.128">so their confidence level is lower.</text><text start="309.505" dur="2.943">However, there is another set of people</text><text start="312.472" dur="3.618">who are very confident in answering
somewhere in the middle.</text><text start="316.657" dur="3.716">We think these high-confident grays
are folks who understand</text><text start="320.397" dur="1.612">that both arguments have merit.</text><text start="322.531" dur="2.699">They&amp;#39;re gray not because they&amp;#39;re unsure,</text><text start="325.254" dur="2.688">but because they believe
that the moral dilemma faces</text><text start="327.966" dur="1.987">two valid, opposing arguments.</text><text start="330.373" dur="4.072">And we discovered that the groups
that include highly confident grays</text><text start="334.469" dur="2.493">are much more likely to reach consensus.</text><text start="336.986" dur="2.478">We do not know yet exactly why this is.</text><text start="339.488" dur="1.763">These are only the first experiments,</text><text start="341.275" dur="3.412">and many more will be needed
to understand why and how</text><text start="344.711" dur="2.822">some people decide to negotiate
their moral standings</text><text start="347.557" dur="1.522">to reach an agreement.</text><text start="349.103" dur="2.469">Now, when groups reach consensus,</text><text start="351.596" dur="1.586">how do they do so?</text><text start="353.206" dur="2.581">The most intuitive idea
is that it&amp;#39;s just the average</text><text start="355.811" dur="2.03">of all the answers in the group, right?</text><text start="357.865" dur="3.573">Another option is that the group
weighs the strength of each vote</text><text start="361.462" dur="2.448">based on the confidence
of the person expressing it.</text><text start="364.422" dur="2.506">Imagine Paul McCartney
is a member of your group.</text><text start="367.352" dur="2.144">You&amp;#39;d be wise to follow his call</text><text start="369.52" dur="2.441">on the number of times
&amp;quot;Yesterday&amp;quot; is repeated,</text><text start="371.985" dur="2.714">which, by the way -- I think it&amp;#39;s nine.</text><text start="374.723" dur="2.381">But instead, we found that consistently,</text><text start="377.128" dur="2.366">in all dilemmas,
in different experiments --</text><text start="379.518" dur="2.165">even on different continents --</text><text start="381.707" dur="3.743">groups implement a smart
and statistically sound procedure</text><text start="385.474" dur="2.178">known as the &amp;quot;robust average.&amp;quot;</text><text start="387.676" dur="2.18">In the case of the height
of the Eiffel Tower,</text><text start="389.88" dur="1.82">let&amp;#39;s say a group has these answers:</text><text start="391.724" dur="4.608">250 meters, 200 meters, 300 meters, 400</text><text start="396.356" dur="3.784">and one totally absurd answer
of 300 million meters.</text><text start="400.547" dur="4.293">A simple average of these numbers
would inaccurately skew the results.</text><text start="404.864" dur="3.17">But the robust average is one
where the group largely ignores</text><text start="408.058" dur="1.24">that absurd answer,</text><text start="409.322" dur="3.369">by giving much more weight
to the vote of the people in the middle.</text><text start="413.305" dur="1.876">Back to the experiment in Vancouver,</text><text start="415.205" dur="1.767">that&amp;#39;s exactly what happened.</text><text start="417.407" dur="2.741">Groups gave much less weight
to the outliers,</text><text start="420.172" dur="3.229">and instead, the consensus
turned out to be a robust average</text><text start="423.425" dur="1.476">of the individual answers.</text><text start="425.356" dur="1.991">The most remarkable thing</text><text start="427.371" dur="3.187">is that this was a spontaneous
behavior of the group.</text><text start="430.582" dur="4.475">It happened without us giving them
any hint on how to reach consensus.</text><text start="435.513" dur="1.54">So where do we go from here?</text><text start="437.432" dur="3.137">This is only the beginning,
but we already have some insights.</text><text start="440.984" dur="2.917">Good collective decisions
require two components:</text><text start="443.925" dur="2.749">deliberation and diversity of opinions.</text><text start="447.066" dur="3.996">Right now, the way we typically
make our voice heard in many societies</text><text start="451.086" dur="1.908">is through direct or indirect voting.</text><text start="453.495" dur="1.997">This is good for diversity of opinions,</text><text start="455.516" dur="2.445">and it has the great virtue of ensuring</text><text start="457.985" dur="2.455">that everyone gets to express their voice.</text><text start="460.464" dur="3.735">But it&amp;#39;s not so good [for fostering]
thoughtful debates.</text><text start="464.665" dur="3.068">Our experiments suggest a different method</text><text start="467.757" dur="3.541">that may be effective in balancing
these two goals at the same time,</text><text start="471.322" dur="3.753">by forming small groups
that converge to a single decision</text><text start="475.099" dur="2.234">while still maintaining
diversity of opinions</text><text start="477.357" dur="2.773">because there are many independent groups.</text><text start="480.741" dur="3.924">Of course, it&amp;#39;s much easier to agree
on the height of the Eiffel Tower</text><text start="484.689" dur="3.115">than on moral, political
and ideological issues.</text><text start="488.721" dur="3.277">But in a time when
the world&amp;#39;s problems are more complex</text><text start="492.022" dur="1.803">and people are more polarized,</text><text start="493.849" dur="4.595">using science to help us understand
how we interact and make decisions</text><text start="498.468" dur="4.666">will hopefully spark interesting new ways
to construct a better democracy.</text></transcript>
