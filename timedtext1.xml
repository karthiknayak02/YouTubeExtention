<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="1.42">Professor Shelly Kagan:
The first question we want to</text><text start="4.554">discuss has to do with the
possibility of my surviving my</text><text start="7.528">death.
Is there life after death?</text><text start="9.53">Is there a possibility that I
might still exist or survive</text><text start="14.22">after my death?
Now at first glance--and in</text><text start="17.232">fact, I think,
at second glance it&amp;#39;s going to</text><text start="19.859">turn out to be true--you might
think that the answer to this</text><text start="23.383">question would depend on two
basic issues.</text><text start="26.19">Do I survive my death?
Do we survive our deaths?</text><text start="29.86">You think, the first thing we
have to get clear on is well</text><text start="33.709">what am I?
What kind of a thing am I?</text><text start="37.48">Or generalizing,
what kind of thing is a person?</text><text start="40.56">What are we made of?
What are our parts?</text><text start="43.89">It seems plausible to think
that before we could answer the</text><text start="48.359">question, &amp;quot;Do I survive?&amp;quot;
we need to know how I&amp;#39;m built.</text><text start="53.09">And so the first thing we&amp;#39;re
going to spend a fair bit of</text><text start="56.227">time on is trying to get clear
on what&amp;#39;s a person?</text><text start="59.14">What are the fundamental
building blocks of a person?</text><text start="63.189">The second question that you
might think we&amp;#39;d want to get</text><text start="66.714">clear on is, &amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s the idea,
or what&amp;#39;s the concept,</text><text start="69.987">of surviving?&amp;quot;
Before we ask, &amp;quot;Do I survive?&amp;quot;</text><text start="73.45">we need to get clear on &amp;quot;What
am I?&amp;quot;</text><text start="75.86">and &amp;quot;What is it to survive?&amp;quot;
What is it for something that</text><text start="80.186">exists in the future to be me?
Now this question can be</text><text start="84.357">discussed philosophically in
quite general terms.</text><text start="87.31">What&amp;#39;s the nature of
persistence of identity over</text><text start="91.874">time?
But since we&amp;#39;re especially</text><text start="94.678">interested in beings like us,
people, this topic,</text><text start="98.79">this sub-specialized version of
the question of identity,</text><text start="102.432">gets discussed under the rubric
of the topic,</text><text start="105.49">personal identity.
What&amp;#39;s the key or the nature or</text><text start="108.635">the basis of personal identity?
As we might put it:</text><text start="112.668">What is it for somebody who&amp;#39;s
here next week to be the same</text><text start="118.187">person as me?
What&amp;#39;s the nature of personal</text><text start="121.011">identity?
So, as I say,</text><text start="122.535">at first glance you might think
to get clear on the answer,</text><text start="127.335">&amp;quot;Do I or might I or could I
survive my death?&amp;quot;</text><text start="131.39">we need to know, what am I?
What&amp;#39;s a person?</text><text start="134.96">What&amp;#39;s the metaphysical
composition of people,</text><text start="137.881">on the one hand?
And we need to get clear on the</text><text start="140.576">nature of identity or
persistence or,</text><text start="142.349">more specifically,
personal identity.</text><text start="144.319">Now as I say,
I believe that when push comes</text><text start="146.583">to shove, we do need to get
clear about both of those</text><text start="149.321">questions and so that&amp;#39;s going to
take the first several weeks of</text><text start="152.637">the class.
We&amp;#39;re going to spend a couple</text><text start="155.348">of weeks talking about,
&amp;quot;What&amp;#39;s a person?&amp;quot;</text><text start="158.12">And then we&amp;#39;re going to spend
several weeks,</text><text start="160.586">or at least a week or so,
talking about the nature of</text><text start="163.568">personal identity.
But before we can even get</text><text start="166.902">started, there&amp;#39;s a question,
really an objection to the</text><text start="171.205">whole enterprise.
So we&amp;#39;re about to spend a lot</text><text start="173.992">of time asking the philosophical
question: Is there life after</text><text start="176.5">death?
Could there be life after death?</text><text start="178.97">Might I survive my death?
But there&amp;#39;s a philosophical</text><text start="182.626">objection to the entire
question.</text><text start="184.36">And the objection is fairly
simple.</text><text start="186.759">It says the whole question is
misconceived.</text><text start="190.88">It&amp;#39;s based on a confusion.
Once we see the confusion,</text><text start="196.095">we can see what the answer to
our question is.</text><text start="200.19">Could I survive my death?
The answer has got to be--this</text><text start="203.588">is what the objection says--the
answer has got to be,</text><text start="206.445">obviously not.
All right, so here&amp;#39;s the</text><text start="208.929">objection.
I should mention that the very</text><text start="211.633">first reading that you&amp;#39;re going
to be doing is a couple of pages</text><text start="215.818">from Jay Rosenberg,
a contemporary philosopher.</text><text start="219.139">He gives us a version of this
objection.</text><text start="222.28">So I&amp;#39;ll give you one version.
You&amp;#39;ll have another version in</text><text start="226.18">your readings.
The objection basically says:</text><text start="229.12">What does it mean to say that
somebody&amp;#39;s died?</text><text start="232.41">We&amp;#39;re asking,
&amp;quot;Is there life after death?&amp;quot;</text><text start="234.44">What does it mean to say that
somebody has died?</text><text start="236.639">Well a natural definition of
death might be something like</text><text start="242.187">the end of life.
So then, if that&amp;#39;s right,</text><text start="245.134">then to ask,
&amp;quot;Is there life after death?&amp;quot;</text><text start="247.139">is just asking,
&amp;quot;Is there life after the end of</text><text start="252.123">life?&amp;quot;
The answer to that ought to be</text><text start="254.822">pretty obvious.
Well, obviously,</text><text start="257.46">the answer to that is no.
After all, if we&amp;#39;re saying once</text><text start="262.675">you&amp;#39;ve run out of life,
is there any more life?</text><text start="266.57">Well, duh!
That&amp;#39;s like asking,</text><text start="269.047">when I&amp;#39;ve eaten up all the food
on my plate, is there any food</text><text start="273.5">left on my plate?
Or what happens in the movie</text><text start="277.345">after the movie ends?
These are stupid questions,</text><text start="281.279">because once you understand
what they&amp;#39;re asking,</text><text start="284.865">the answer is just built in.
It follows trivially.</text><text start="288.55">So although it has seemed to
people over the ages that the</text><text start="291.441">question, &amp;quot;Is there life after
death?&amp;quot;</text><text start="293.47">is one of the great mysteries,
one of the great philosophical</text><text start="297.305">things to ponder,
the objection says that&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="300.117">kind of illusion.
In fact, once you think about</text><text start="303.196">it, and not all that long,
you can see the answer&amp;#39;s got to</text><text start="306.61">be no.
There couldn&amp;#39;t possibly be life</text><text start="308.826">after death.
There couldn&amp;#39;t possibly be life</text><text start="312.061">after the end of life.
Or suppose we ask the question</text><text start="315.46">in a slightly different way.
Might I survive my death?</text><text start="321.399">Well what does the word
&amp;quot;survive&amp;quot; mean?</text><text start="324.509">Well, survive is something like
we say that somebody&amp;#39;s a</text><text start="328.443">survivor if something&amp;#39;s happened
and they haven&amp;#39;t died.</text><text start="332.52">They&amp;#39;re still alive.
When there&amp;#39;s a car accident,</text><text start="336.59">you ask, so-and-so died,
so-and-so survived.</text><text start="340.11">This person survived.
To say that they survived is</text><text start="343.059">just saying that they&amp;#39;re still
alive.</text><text start="345.38">So, &amp;quot;Might I survive my death?&amp;quot;
is like asking,</text><text start="350.997">&amp;quot;Might I still be alive
after&amp;quot;--well what&amp;#39;s death?</text><text start="356.43">Death is the end of life.
So-- &amp;quot;might I still be alive</text><text start="360.332">after I&amp;#39;ve stopped living?
Might I be one of the people</text><text start="364.914">who didn&amp;#39;t die when I died?&amp;quot;
Gosh, the answer to that is,</text><text start="368.971">again, duh!
No.</text><text start="370.29">You couldn&amp;#39;t possibly survive
your death, given the very</text><text start="373.234">definition.
It should remind us of--at</text><text start="375.991">least it reminds me of this joke
that you probably told.</text><text start="380.509">It seemed hysterical when you
were seven.</text><text start="383.81">The plane crashes exactly on
the border of Canada and the</text><text start="390.094">United States.
Exactly on the border.</text><text start="393.73">There&amp;#39;s dead people everywhere.
Where do they bury the</text><text start="398.413">survivors?
The answer is:</text><text start="400.661">You don&amp;#39;t bury the survivors.
So when you&amp;#39;re seven you think,</text><text start="403.678">&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know.
Do they bury them in Canada?</text><text start="405.17">Do they bury them in America?&amp;quot;
The answer is:</text><text start="408.054">You don&amp;#39;t bury the survivors,
because survivors are people</text><text start="412.347">that haven&amp;#39;t yet died.
So, &amp;quot;Can I survive my death?&amp;quot;</text><text start="416.649">is like asking,
&amp;quot;Could I not have yet died</text><text start="419.558">after…?&amp;quot;
The answer is,</text><text start="421.355">of course, you have to have
died if you died and you haven&amp;#39;t</text><text start="425.337">survived if you&amp;#39;ve died.
So the question can&amp;#39;t even get</text><text start="429.331">off the ground.
That, at least,</text><text start="431.611">is how the objection goes.
Now I don&amp;#39;t mean to be utterly</text><text start="435.424">dismissive of the objection.
That&amp;#39;s why I spent a couple of</text><text start="438.732">minutes trying to spell it out.
But I think there&amp;#39;s a way to</text><text start="444.03">respond to it.
We just have to get clearer</text><text start="447.586">about what precisely the
question is that we&amp;#39;re trying to</text><text start="450.94">ask.
This is something that</text><text start="452.372">Rosenberg tries to get clear on
as well.</text><text start="454.259">So here&amp;#39;s my attempt to make
the question both a bit more</text><text start="457.561">precise, and a question that&amp;#39;s
an open question.</text><text start="460.509">A question we can legitimately
raise.</text><text start="464.18">Well, now as you will hear on
several occasions over the</text><text start="467.091">course of the semester,
I&amp;#39;m a philosopher.</text><text start="469.42">What that means is I don&amp;#39;t
really know a whole lot of</text><text start="472.93">facts.
So I&amp;#39;m about to tell you a</text><text start="475.112">story where I wish I knew the
facts.</text><text start="477.45">I don&amp;#39;t know the facts.
If I could really do it right,</text><text start="482.135">I&amp;#39;d now open the door and bring
in our guest physiologist,</text><text start="488.42">who would then provide the
facts that I&amp;#39;m--what I&amp;#39;m about</text><text start="491.415">to go is &amp;quot;blah,
blah, blah.&amp;quot;</text><text start="493.019">But we have the physiologist
come in and he&amp;#39;d actually tell</text><text start="497.194">us these things.
I don&amp;#39;t know them.</text><text start="499.54">I don&amp;#39;t have that person.
But take a look at what happens</text><text start="503.667">when a body dies.
Now, no doubt,</text><text start="506.13">you can kill people in a lot of
different ways.</text><text start="508.43">You can poison them,
you can strangle them,</text><text start="512.823">you can shoot them in the
heart.</text><text start="516.379">The causal paths that result in
death may start different,</text><text start="521.235">but I presume that they
converge and you end up having a</text><text start="525.919">set of events take place.
Now what are those events?</text><text start="530.259">This is exactly where I don&amp;#39;t
really know the details,</text><text start="533.563">but I take it it&amp;#39;s something
like: because of whatever the</text><text start="537.116">original input was,
eventually the blood&amp;#39;s no</text><text start="540.332">longer circulating and oxygen
isn&amp;#39;t making its way around the</text><text start="544.609">body.
So the brain becomes</text><text start="546.73">oxygen-starved.
Because of the lack of oxygen</text><text start="549.956">getting to the cells,
the cells are no longer able to</text><text start="553.518">carry on their various metabolic
processes.</text><text start="556.669">Because of this,
they can&amp;#39;t repair the various</text><text start="559.589">kinds of damage they need,
or create the amino acids and</text><text start="563.157">proteins they need.
So as decay begins to set in</text><text start="566.368">and the cell structures begin to
break down, they don&amp;#39;t get</text><text start="569.927">repaired as they would normally
do,</text><text start="572.259">and so eventually have
breakdown of the crucial cell</text><text start="574.976">structure and boom,
the body&amp;#39;s dead.</text><text start="577">Now as I say,
I don&amp;#39;t really know whether</text><text start="579.426">that&amp;#39;s accurate,
the little rough story I just</text><text start="582.155">told, but some story like that
is probably right.</text><text start="585.37">And in typical philosophical
fashion, I&amp;#39;ve drawn that story</text><text start="589.703">for you up here on the board.
So the events that I don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="594.034">really know the details of,
we can just call B_1,</text><text start="598.527">B_2,
B_3,</text><text start="600.696">up through B_n.
Before B_1 begins,</text><text start="604.897">you&amp;#39;ve got the body working,
functioning,</text><text start="607.579">in its bodily way--respirating,
reproducing the cells,</text><text start="611.132">and so forth and so on.
And at the end of the process,</text><text start="616.346">by B_n,
the body&amp;#39;s dead.</text><text start="620.24">B for bodily.
B_1 through</text><text start="623.248">B_n;
that&amp;#39;s what death is.</text><text start="625.32">At least, that&amp;#39;s what death of
the body is.</text><text start="627.49">As I say, it&amp;#39;s the sort of
thing that somebody from the</text><text start="630.947">medical school or a biologist or
a physiologist or something</text><text start="634.725">could describe for us.
So here&amp;#39;s the question then.</text><text start="638.129">Suppose we call that process
&amp;quot;death of the body.&amp;quot;</text><text start="645.309">Call what has occurred by the
end of that sequence of events,</text><text start="650.904">&amp;quot;bodily death.&amp;quot;
Now here&amp;#39;s a question that we</text><text start="654.336">can still ask,
at least it looks as though we</text><text start="657.136">can still ask it.
Might I, or do I,</text><text start="660.855">still exist after the death of
my body?</text><text start="666.61">Might I still exist after
bodily death?</text><text start="672.72">I don&amp;#39;t mean to suggest in any
way that we yet know the answer</text><text start="676.311">to that question,
but at least that&amp;#39;s a question</text><text start="679.028">that it seems as though we can
coherently raise.</text><text start="681.639">There&amp;#39;s no obvious
contradiction in asking:</text><text start="686.126">Might I still exist after the
death of my body?</text><text start="691.36"></text><text start="694.899">The answer could turn out to be
no.</text><text start="698.61">But at least it&amp;#39;s not obviously
no.</text><text start="702.75">If the answer turns out to be
no, it&amp;#39;s going to take some</text><text start="706.488">sustained argument to settle it
one way or the other.</text><text start="710.159">The answer could turn out to be
yes, for all we know at this</text><text start="714.069">point.
This just brings us back to the</text><text start="716.596">thought that whether or not I
could still exist after the</text><text start="720.202">death of my body looks like it
should depend on what I am.</text><text start="724.129">So in a minute,
that&amp;#39;s the question that I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="727.056">going to turn to.
But it&amp;#39;s a bit cumbersome to</text><text start="730.715">constantly be asking:
Might I still exist after the</text><text start="734.94">death of my body?
So no harm is done,</text><text start="737.995">once we&amp;#39;ve clarified the
question that we&amp;#39;re trying to</text><text start="741.802">ask, if we summarize that
question in a bit of a jargon or</text><text start="745.897">slogan.
We say, instead of asking:</text><text start="748.41">Might I survive?
Or: Might I continue to exist</text><text start="750.578">after the death of my body?
--you might put it this way.</text><text start="754.789">You might say for short:
Will I survive the death of my</text><text start="758.977">body?
No harm done.</text><text start="760.48">Or: Will I survive my death?
Because what we were just</text><text start="765.511">stipulating we mean when we talk
about my death in the context of</text><text start="768.741">this question is the death of my
body.</text><text start="770.81">No harm done.
We can just say for short:</text><text start="773.662">Will I survive my death or
might I survive my death?</text><text start="778.09">For that matter,
no serious harm done if we ask:</text><text start="782.457">Is there life after death?
As long as we understand that</text><text start="786.89">what we&amp;#39;re not asking about
there is life of my body.</text><text start="790.299">Just another familiar way of
trying to ask:</text><text start="793.173">Will I still be around after my
death?</text><text start="795.909">Will I still exist after my
death?</text><text start="798.37">So I think there&amp;#39;s a perfectly
legitimate question and that&amp;#39;s</text><text start="802.931">the question we now want to turn
to.</text><text start="805.82">As I said, it looks as though
to answer the question,</text><text start="808.816">&amp;quot;Could I continue to exist
after the death of my</text><text start="811.524">body?&amp;quot;--&amp;quot;Is there life after
death?&amp;quot;</text><text start="813.83">&amp;quot;Could I survive my death?&amp;quot;
for short--to answer that</text><text start="817.252">question, we need to get clearer
about: What exactly is it for</text><text start="821.065">something to be me?
That&amp;#39;s a question we&amp;#39;ll turn to</text><text start="824.317">in a couple of weeks.
First, we&amp;#39;ve got to get clearer</text><text start="829.161">about: What am I?
What kind of an entity am I?</text><text start="835.25">What am I made of?
In philosophical jargon,</text><text start="838.08">this is a question from
metaphysics.</text><text start="840.24">So we&amp;#39;re asking the
metaphysical question:</text><text start="843.843">What kind of a thing is a
person?</text><text start="846.919">It seems plausible to think
that whether or not a person can</text><text start="851.226">survive or continue to exist
after the death of his or her</text><text start="855.387">body should depend on how he&amp;#39;s
built,</text><text start="858.379">what he&amp;#39;s made of,
what his or her parts are.</text><text start="863.12">So, let me sketch for you two
basic positions on this</text><text start="870.375">question.
What is a person?</text><text start="873.14">Two basic positions.
They&amp;#39;re both,</text><text start="877.319">I imagine, fairly familiar.
What we&amp;#39;re going to have to do</text><text start="881.88">is try to decide between them.
They&amp;#39;re not the only possible</text><text start="885.247">positions on the question of the
metaphysics of the person.</text><text start="888.49">But they&amp;#39;re,
I think, the two most prominent</text><text start="890.823">positions and definitely the
ones most worth taking seriously</text><text start="894.08">for our purposes.
So, first possible position is</text><text start="898.828">this.
A person is a combination of a</text><text start="904.511">body and something else--a mind.
But the crucial thing about</text><text start="911.5">this first view that we want to
talk about is that the mind is</text><text start="914.956">thought of as something separate
from,</text><text start="917.28">and distinct from, the body.
To use a common enough word,</text><text start="924.685">it&amp;#39;s a soul.
So people are,</text><text start="927.398">or people have,
or people consist of,</text><text start="931.738">bodies and souls.
The soul is something,</text><text start="935.913">as I say, distinct from the
body.</text><text start="938.639">I take it the idea of the body
is a familiar one.</text><text start="941.57">It&amp;#39;s this lump of flesh and
bone and muscle that&amp;#39;s sitting</text><text start="945.711">here in front of you and that
each one of you sort of drags</text><text start="949.926">around with you.
It&amp;#39;s the sort of thing that we</text><text start="953.794">can put on a scale and prod with
a stick and the biologists can</text><text start="958.785">study,
presumably made up of various</text><text start="961.023">kinds of molecules,
atoms and so forth.</text><text start="963.11">So we&amp;#39;ve got the body.
But on this first view,</text><text start="967.861">we also have something that&amp;#39;s
not body.</text><text start="971.69">Something that&amp;#39;s not a material
object.</text><text start="974.659">Something that&amp;#39;s not composed
of molecules and atoms.</text><text start="978.12">It&amp;#39;s a soul.
It&amp;#39;s the house of,</text><text start="981.37">or the seat of,
or the basis of,</text><text start="984.247">consciousness and thinking,
perhaps personality.</text><text start="988.98">But the crucial point for this
view is that the proper</text><text start="993.319">metaphysical understanding of
the mind is to think of it in</text><text start="998.068">nonphysical terms,
nonmaterial terms.</text><text start="1002.45">That, as I say,
is the first basic view.</text><text start="1005.269">I&amp;#39;m going to say more about
that view, a fair bit more about</text><text start="1007.815">that view, over the next couple
of weeks.</text><text start="1009.669">First, let me sketch the other
basic view.</text><text start="1012.539">So this first view we can call
&amp;quot;the dualist view.&amp;quot;</text><text start="1017.36">Dualist, of course,
because there&amp;#39;s two basic</text><text start="1021.237">components--the body and the
soul.</text><text start="1024.41">Although I may occasionally
slip, I&amp;#39;m going to try to</text><text start="1027.793">preserve the word &amp;quot;soul.&amp;quot;
When I use the word &amp;quot;soul,&amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m</text><text start="1031.919">going to have in mind this
dualist view according to which</text><text start="1036.275">the soul is something
immaterial, nonphysical.</text><text start="1040.019">Some other kind--the body is a
material substance.</text><text start="1043.4">The soul is an immaterial
substance.</text><text start="1047.9">That&amp;#39;s the dualist view.
The alternative view that we&amp;#39;re</text><text start="1051.666">going to consider is not
dualist, but monist.</text><text start="1055.49">It says there&amp;#39;s one basic kind
of thing and only one basic kind</text><text start="1061.639">of thing.
There are bodies.</text><text start="1064.84">So what&amp;#39;s a person?
A person is just a certain kind</text><text start="1070.071">of material object.
A person is just a body.</text><text start="1075.619">Of course, it&amp;#39;s a very fancy
material object.</text><text start="1081.38">It&amp;#39;s a very amazing material
object.</text><text start="1084.809">That&amp;#39;s what this second view
says.</text><text start="1087.48">The person is a body that can
do things that most other</text><text start="1093.288">material objects can&amp;#39;t do.
So on the monist view--which</text><text start="1098.617">we&amp;#39;ll call &amp;quot;physicalism,&amp;quot;
because it says that what people</text><text start="1103.336">just are,
are these physical objects--on</text><text start="1106.851">the physicalist view,
a person is just a body that</text><text start="1110.968">can…now you fill in the blank.
You point out the kinds of</text><text start="1115.252">things that we can do.
We can talk.</text><text start="1118.54">We can think.
We can sing.</text><text start="1120.49">We can write poetry.
We can fall in love.</text><text start="1122.63">We can be afraid.
We can make plans.</text><text start="1125.44">We can discover things about
the universe.</text><text start="1128.97">According to the physicalist
view, a person is just a body</text><text start="1132.768">that can do all of those things:
can reflect,</text><text start="1135.9">can be rational,
can communicate,</text><text start="1138.693">can make plans,
can fall in love,</text><text start="1141.486">can write poetry.
That&amp;#39;s the physicalist view.</text><text start="1144.91">As I say, we&amp;#39;ve got two basic
positions.</text><text start="1148.65">There&amp;#39;s the dualist
view--people are bodies and</text><text start="1153.181">souls.
And there&amp;#39;s the physicalist</text><text start="1155.931">view, according to which there
are no souls.</text><text start="1159.2">There are no immaterial objects
like that.</text><text start="1163.819">There are only bodies,
though when you&amp;#39;ve got a</text><text start="1166.785">functioning body like ours,
so the physicalist says,</text><text start="1170.072">these bodies can do some pretty
amazing things.</text><text start="1173.359">The kind of things that we all
know people can do.</text><text start="1176.66">Two basic views.
From a logical point of view,</text><text start="1179.218">I suppose you might have a
third possible view.</text><text start="1181.829">If we&amp;#39;ve got the monist who
says there&amp;#39;s bodies but there&amp;#39;s</text><text start="1186.295">no souls, you could imagine
somebody who says there are</text><text start="1190.452">souls but there are no bodies.
This would roughly be a view</text><text start="1194.462">according to which there are
minds, but there aren&amp;#39;t really</text><text start="1197.345">physical objects.
Physical objects are a kind of</text><text start="1200.201">illusion, perhaps,
that we fall into.</text><text start="1202.559">Or thinking about them in
materialistic terms might be</text><text start="1205.922">greatly confused or mistaken.
This view is sometimes known in</text><text start="1210.323">philosophy as idealism:
all that exists,</text><text start="1213.383">are minds and their ideas.
Physical objects is just a way</text><text start="1217.756">of talking about the ideas the
mind has or something like that.</text><text start="1222.23">Idealism is a position that&amp;#39;s
got a very long history in</text><text start="1225.473">philosophy and for many classes
would be worth taking a fair bit</text><text start="1229.189">of time to consider more
carefully.</text><text start="1231.49">But for our purposes,
I think it&amp;#39;s not a contender.</text><text start="1234.029">So I&amp;#39;m just going to put it
aside.</text><text start="1237.17">The positions that I&amp;#39;m going
to--and there are other</text><text start="1239.862">possibilities as well.
There are views where mind and</text><text start="1243.573">body are just two different ways
of looking at the same</text><text start="1247.971">underlying reality where the
underlying reality is neither</text><text start="1252.613">physical nor mental.
That view&amp;#39;s also worth taking</text><text start="1256.292">seriously in a metaphysics
class, but for our purposes,</text><text start="1259.35">I mention it and put it aside.
The two views we are going to</text><text start="1263.598">focus on are,
on the one hand,</text><text start="1265.976">the dualist view--people have
souls as well as bodies--and the</text><text start="1270.979">physicalist view--all we have,
all we are, are bodies.</text><text start="1275.89"></text><text start="1279.65">Let me say something more then
about the dualist position.</text><text start="1285.339">According to the dualist,
the mind is this immaterial</text><text start="1288.875">substance and we could call it
by different names.</text><text start="1292.41">No harm would be done if we
call it a mind,</text><text start="1295.382">though the reason I will
typically talk about a soul is</text><text start="1299.205">to try to flag the crucial point
of the dualist view.</text><text start="1303.24">The mind is based in,
or just is something</text><text start="1309.064">nonphysical, something
nonmaterial…The soul can</text><text start="1315.884">direct and give orders to the
body, on the one hand.</text><text start="1323.839">On the other hand,
the body generates input that</text><text start="1329.72">eventually gets sensed or felt
by the soul.</text><text start="1335.349">You take a pin and you stick it
through my flesh of my body and</text><text start="1343.817">I feel pain in my soul,
in my mind.</text><text start="1348.87">So, two-way interaction.
As always with philosophy,</text><text start="1352.991">there&amp;#39;s more complicated
versions of dualism where maybe</text><text start="1356.761">the interaction doesn&amp;#39;t work
both ways,</text><text start="1359.64">but let&amp;#39;s just limit ourselves
to good, old-fashioned,</text><text start="1365.278">two-way interactionist dualism.
So my mind controls my body.</text><text start="1372.289">My body can affect my mind in
various ways.</text><text start="1376.18">But for all that,
they&amp;#39;re separate things.</text><text start="1379.38">Still there&amp;#39;s this very tight
connection.</text><text start="1382.04"></text><text start="1387.789">We sometimes put it:
the soul is in the body,</text><text start="1391.465">though talking about spatial
locations here may be somewhat</text><text start="1396.31">metaphorically intended.
It&amp;#39;s not as though we think</text><text start="1400.087">that if you start opening up the
body you&amp;#39;d finally find the</text><text start="1403.228">particular spot.
Here&amp;#39;s the place where the soul</text><text start="1406.943">is located.
Though it does seem,</text><text start="1409.176">from this dualist perspective,
as though souls are located,</text><text start="1412.618">I&amp;#39;m sort of viewing the world
from here.</text><text start="1415.17">Just like each of you is
viewing the world from a</text><text start="1417.295">particular location.
So maybe your soul is located,</text><text start="1420.661">more or less,
in the vicinity of your body.</text><text start="1424.17">Crucial point,
of course, the attraction of</text><text start="1427.292">the dualist view,
from our point of view,</text><text start="1430.49">is that if there&amp;#39;s a soul as
well as the body,</text><text start="1434.336">and the soul is something
immaterial,</text><text start="1437.67">then when the body dies,
when we have B_1</text><text start="1440.347">through B_n and the
death of the body occurs.</text><text start="1443.4">So at the end of B_n,
the body stops repairing</text><text start="1446.657">itself.
Decay sets in.</text><text start="1448.7">We all know the sad story.
The worms crawl in,</text><text start="1451.675">the worms crawl out.
At the end of the day--well it</text><text start="1454.945">maybe it takes longer than a
day--the body has decomposed.</text><text start="1458.93">Yes, all that bespeaks the end
of the body.</text><text start="1464.299">But if the soul is something
immaterial, then that could</text><text start="1469.46">continue to exist,
even after the destruction of</text><text start="1473.87">the body.
That&amp;#39;s the attraction,</text><text start="1476.916">at least one of the
attractions, of the dualist</text><text start="1480.735">view.
The belief in the soul gives</text><text start="1483.75">you something to continue to
exist after the end of your</text><text start="1488.368">body.
So what&amp;#39;s death?</text><text start="1491.049">Well, if normally there&amp;#39;s this
super tight connection between</text><text start="1498.254">my soul and my body,
death might be the severing of</text><text start="1504.258">that connection.
So the body breaks and no</text><text start="1508.82">longer is able to give input up
to the soul.</text><text start="1512.71">The soul is no longer able to
control the body and make it</text><text start="1517.775">move around.
But for all that,</text><text start="1520.559">the soul might continue to
exist.</text><text start="1523.64">And so at least the possibility
that I&amp;#39;ll survive my death is</text><text start="1528.308">one worth taking very,
very seriously if we are</text><text start="1531.888">dualists.</text><text start="1532.9"></text><text start="1536.559">A couple of things to point out
about this view.</text><text start="1541.75">One is I&amp;#39;ve been talking as
though a person is a</text><text start="1547.642">combination, kind of a soul and
body sandwich.</text><text start="1553.66"></text><text start="1557.21">So a person has two basic
building blocks.</text><text start="1561.609">The bodily part and the soul
part.</text><text start="1564.48">It&amp;#39;s natural to talk that way,
but if we want belief in the</text><text start="1568.607">soul to help us hold out the
possibility at least that there</text><text start="1572.805">might be life after death,
then I think we need to</text><text start="1577.079">actually say that strictly
speaking, it&amp;#39;s not that a person</text><text start="1582.474">is a soul plus a body.
Strictly speaking,</text><text start="1586.371">I think we need to say the
person just is the soul.</text><text start="1590.91">After all, if the person is the
combination, if the person is</text><text start="1596.199">the pair, soul plus the body,
destroy the body,</text><text start="1600.255">you&amp;#39;ve destroyed the pair.
If the person is the pair and</text><text start="1605.39">the pair no longer exists,
the person no longer exists.</text><text start="1610.2">So if we want belief in a soul
to help us leave open the door</text><text start="1615.034">to the possibility that I
survive the destruction of my</text><text start="1619.384">body,
it had better not be that the</text><text start="1622.397">body is an essential part of me.
It&amp;#39;s simpler,</text><text start="1626.551">more straightforward to say
instead, &amp;quot;What I am strictly</text><text start="1633.115">speaking is a soul.&amp;quot;
As long as the soul exists,</text><text start="1637.532">I exist.</text><text start="1638.09"></text><text start="1641.47">Of course, my soul,
me, I, have a very tight</text><text start="1646.501">connection to a particular body.
But still, you could,</text><text start="1651.597">in principle,
destroy the body without</text><text start="1653.565">destroying me.
Look, I have a particularly</text><text start="1656.463">close connection to the house I
live in.</text><text start="1659.49">But for all that,
you can destroy my house</text><text start="1663.255">without destroying me.
So that&amp;#39;s I think the position</text><text start="1667.483">that we ought to ascribe to the
dualist.</text><text start="1670.25">The person is,
strictly speaking,</text><text start="1672.549">the soul.
The soul has a very intimate</text><text start="1674.81">connection with the body,
but the person is not the soul</text><text start="1677.699">and the body.
The person is just the soul.</text><text start="1680.19">So even if that intimate
connection gets destroyed,</text><text start="1684.021">the person, the soul,
could continue to exist.</text><text start="1687.7">The second point to clear up is
that there&amp;#39;s really three</text><text start="1692.208">different issues that might
interest us.</text><text start="1695.589">One, metaphysically,
are bodies and souls distinct?</text><text start="1701.319">Is the mind to be understood in
terms of this immaterial object,</text><text start="1708.326">the soul?
So are there two kinds of</text><text start="1710.837">things?
That&amp;#39;s the first question.</text><text start="1712.49">Are souls and bodies distinct?
Second question,</text><text start="1718.305">though, is: Does the soul,
even if it exists,</text><text start="1723.959">survive the destruction of the
body?</text><text start="1728.97">It could be something separate
without surviving.</text><text start="1732.46">That&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;ve tried to say if
there are souls,</text><text start="1736.33">at least that opens the door to
the possibility that we will</text><text start="1741.188">survive our death.
But, it doesn&amp;#39;t guarantee it,</text><text start="1745.281">because absent further
argumentation,</text><text start="1748.112">there&amp;#39;s no guarantee that the
soul survives the death of the</text><text start="1752.753">body.
Even if it&amp;#39;s separate,</text><text start="1754.814">it could be that it gets killed
at the very same time or</text><text start="1757.999">destroyed at the very same time
that the body&amp;#39;s being destroyed.</text><text start="1761.88">Maybe when these physical
processes, B_1 through</text><text start="1767.465">B_n,
take place,</text><text start="1770.21">they set into motion--remember,
after all we&amp;#39;re interactionist</text><text start="1773.565">dualists.
There&amp;#39;s this very tight causal</text><text start="1776.108">connection between the body and
the mind and the soul and the</text><text start="1779.986">body, the body and the soul.
Just like when you prick my</text><text start="1784.027">body, that bodily process sets
up certain things taking place</text><text start="1788.553">in my soul.
Maybe when B_1</text><text start="1791.83">through B_n take
place, they set up some other</text><text start="1796.919">processes in my soul.
Call them S_1 through</text><text start="1803.453">S_n.
And maybe S_1 through</text><text start="1807.636">S_n results in the
destruction of my soul.</text><text start="1811.22">So simultaneously with my body
dying, my soul dies.</text><text start="1819.559">Okay, this one&amp;#39;s going to be a
little bit trickier to draw.</text><text start="1822.95">The first part,
S_1...,</text><text start="1825.85">that&amp;#39;s easy.
S_n.</text><text start="1828.48">The question is:
How do I draw the soul?</text><text start="1830.15">I don&amp;#39;t really know .</text><text start="1830.63"></text><text start="1840.45">So the mere fact that we
decide, if we do ultimately</text><text start="1844.309">decide that there is a soul,
something nonphysical,</text><text start="1848.443">separate and distinct from the
body, doesn&amp;#39;t guarantee that we</text><text start="1853.609">survive our physical death.
That&amp;#39;s going to be a separate</text><text start="1857.766">question we&amp;#39;ll have to turn to.
The first question&amp;#39;s going to</text><text start="1860.855">be: Are there any souls?
Next question is going to have</text><text start="1863.981">to be: If there are,
do we have any good reason to</text><text start="1867.25">think that they survive the
death of the body?</text><text start="1870.519">Third question that might
interest us, that does interest</text><text start="1875.91">us, is this: If it survives,
how long does it survive?</text><text start="1881.299">Does the soul continue to exist
after the death of the body?</text><text start="1886.21">Does it continue to exist
forever?</text><text start="1890.93">Are we immortal?</text><text start="1893.27"></text><text start="1896.44">Most of us would like that to
be true.</text><text start="1898.329">We want there to be souls so
that we can be immortal.</text><text start="1903.7">And so the question&amp;#39;s got to be
not only, is the soul distinct?</text><text start="1908.559">Does it survive the death of my
body?</text><text start="1910.69">But does it continue to exist
forever?</text><text start="1913.46"></text><text start="1917.39">Those questions--hang on one
second--are ones that especially</text><text start="1921.839">interest Plato.
So in about a week or so we&amp;#39;ll</text><text start="1924.519">start reading Plato&amp;#39;s
Phaedo.</text><text start="1926.269">The purpose of that dialogue,
of that philosophical work,</text><text start="1931.013">is to argue for the immortality
of the soul.</text><text start="1934.91">That&amp;#39;s a question we&amp;#39;ll be
turning to.</text><text start="1936.12">Yeah?
Student: [inaudible]</text><text start="1947.721">Professor Shelly Kagan:
Great.</text><text start="1963.05">So the question is this.
If the very idea of soul that</text><text start="1966.696">we&amp;#39;re working with here under
the dualist picture is the soul</text><text start="1970.145">as an immaterial substance,
it&amp;#39;s not made of ordinary</text><text start="1974.282">atomic matter.
If the soul is immaterial,</text><text start="1977.942">doesn&amp;#39;t it follow
automatically,</text><text start="1980.579">trivially, that the soul can&amp;#39;t
be destroyed by a material</text><text start="1985.343">process?
After all, there was death of</text><text start="1987.701">the body, B_1 through
B_n.</text><text start="1989.73">That&amp;#39;s a material process,
a physical process.</text><text start="1992.599">Doesn&amp;#39;t it follow that a soul,
an immaterial entity,</text><text start="1997.704">can&amp;#39;t be destroyed by a
material, physical process?</text><text start="2003.01">That&amp;#39;s a great question.
What I want to say is,</text><text start="2006.219">the short answer for now is,
I don&amp;#39;t think it follows</text><text start="2010.447">automatically.
It doesn&amp;#39;t follow trivially.</text><text start="2014.46">It may follow.
Plato&amp;#39;s actually going to give</text><text start="2017.768">us some arguments for pretty
much that same claim.</text><text start="2021.029">Plato&amp;#39;s going to argue once we
understand the sort of</text><text start="2025.185">metaphysical nature of the soul,
we&amp;#39;ll see why it couldn&amp;#39;t be</text><text start="2029.981">destroyed.
That&amp;#39;s going to take some fancy</text><text start="2032.753">arguments.
The reason I think it doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="2035.601">follow trivially is because,
remember, I said we&amp;#39;re dealing</text><text start="2040.123">with interactionist dualism.
We&amp;#39;ve already admitted that</text><text start="2045.058">bodies are able to affect the
soul, right?</text><text start="2049.07">The body is having all sorts of
light bounce off my eyes of</text><text start="2054.007">various wavelengths.
And because of that my soul is</text><text start="2057.975">having various visual sensations
about the number of people in</text><text start="2062.236">front of me, colors,
and so forth and so on.</text><text start="2065.519">I gave the example of pricking
my body.</text><text start="2067.559">That&amp;#39;s a physical process that
causes some sorts of changes in</text><text start="2073.363">the mental processes occurring
in my soul.</text><text start="2077.55">Once we&amp;#39;ve admitted that on
this kind of dualist picture the</text><text start="2083.081">material body can influence what
happens in the immaterial soul,</text><text start="2089.269">then it doesn&amp;#39;t seem that we
have any grounds for shutting</text><text start="2092.436">the door to the possibility that
the right physical process,</text><text start="2095.88">B_1 through
B_n,</text><text start="2098.321">might set up this horrible
mental, soul process,</text><text start="2101.809">S_1 through
S_n,</text><text start="2103.443">resulting in the destruction of
the soul.</text><text start="2105.45">It&amp;#39;s a possibility.
It&amp;#39;s going to take more</text><text start="2108.27">arguments to rule it out.
Yeah?</text><text start="2110.53">Student: [inaudible]
Professor Shelly Kagan:</text><text start="2124.844">Yeah, another great question.
The question was:</text><text start="2133.788">I said it seems plausible to
say my soul is located,</text><text start="2137.262">more or less,
here because I seem to view the</text><text start="2140.259">world from here.
But maybe that&amp;#39;s not right.</text><text start="2144.65">Maybe we shouldn&amp;#39;t talk about
the location of the soul at all.</text><text start="2149.269">After all, if the soul is an
immaterial object,</text><text start="2154.811">can immaterial objects have
locations?</text><text start="2159.63">I don&amp;#39;t know.
The short answer is I don&amp;#39;t</text><text start="2163.32">know.
I know very little about how</text><text start="2165.952">immaterial objects are supposed
to work.</text><text start="2169.059">So although I&amp;#39;m trying to
sketch the dualist position,</text><text start="2174.006">as I explained on Tuesday,
I don&amp;#39;t myself believe in</text><text start="2178.766">souls.
I don&amp;#39;t actually think that the</text><text start="2183.071">dualist view is correct.
You might say,</text><text start="2186.952">I&amp;#39;ll leave that problem--are
souls spatially located or</text><text start="2191.434">not--to be worked out by those
who believe in it.</text><text start="2195.75">For our purposes,
I think it doesn&amp;#39;t really</text><text start="2198.895">matter.
If you want to say souls have a</text><text start="2201.458">location, where are they
located?</text><text start="2203.53">They&amp;#39;re located more or less
where my body is.</text><text start="2205.55">At least, as long as my body&amp;#39;s
working.</text><text start="2207.679">Maybe at death the soul gets
liberated from the body and is</text><text start="2211.519">able to wander more freely.
Sometimes people talk about,</text><text start="2214.933">in fact we&amp;#39;ll be reading about
this, out-of-body experiences.</text><text start="2218.239">And so maybe during those
unusual times the soul wanders</text><text start="2221.432">from the body and comes back to
it.</text><text start="2223.579">Or, alternatively,
maybe the soul doesn&amp;#39;t have any</text><text start="2226.454">location at all.
Maybe that&amp;#39;s just an illusion</text><text start="2229.758">created by the fact that I&amp;#39;m
getting this visual input from</text><text start="2234.256">my body.
My body certainly has a</text><text start="2236.991">location.
Maybe the right way--imagine</text><text start="2239.605">somebody who was in a room with
remote control television setup</text><text start="2243.582">and so forth and so on.
And he&amp;#39;s seeing what&amp;#39;s</text><text start="2246.872">happening in Chicago,
even though he&amp;#39;s sitting in a</text><text start="2250.56">room in New Haven.
Well, you could understand why</text><text start="2253.884">he might fall into the trap of
thinking of himself as located</text><text start="2257.432">in Chicago with all the visual
inputs coming from Chicago.</text><text start="2261.039">So maybe that&amp;#39;s how it works
with the soul.</text><text start="2262.909">We get lulled into thinking
that we are where our bodies</text><text start="2266.453">are.
But that&amp;#39;s really a</text><text start="2267.939">metaphysical illusion.
I don&amp;#39;t really know.</text><text start="2270.889">For our purposes,
I think it&amp;#39;s not crucial.</text><text start="2273.9">Though it&amp;#39;s a great question,
but I&amp;#39;m not going to try to</text><text start="2277.427">pursue it any further.
All right.</text><text start="2279.559">So one question:
Is there a soul?</text><text start="2281.46">Second question:
Does it survive the death of</text><text start="2284.748">our body?
Third question:</text><text start="2286.43">If it does, does it live
forever?</text><text start="2288.38">Does it continue to exist
forever?</text><text start="2289.59">Is the soul immortal?
We will initially think about</text><text start="2293.841">the first question:
Do we have any good reason to</text><text start="2297.469">believe in souls at all?
And only after a while will we</text><text start="2301.655">turn to the second and third
question: Does it survive and,</text><text start="2305.803">more particularly,
is it immortal?</text><text start="2308.449">That&amp;#39;s the first basic view
about the nature of a person.</text><text start="2313.039">A person has a soul,
something immaterial and not a</text><text start="2318.013">body.
I take it that the view is a</text><text start="2320.396">familiar one.
Many of you probably believe in</text><text start="2322.816">it.
Those of you who don&amp;#39;t believe</text><text start="2324.073">in it have probably,
at least, been tempted to</text><text start="2325.653">believe in it.
I&amp;#39;m sure you all do know people</text><text start="2328.252">who believe in it.
It&amp;#39;s a very familiar picture.</text><text start="2333.21">But, of course,
the question we&amp;#39;re going to</text><text start="2335.069">have to ask ourselves is:
Is it right?</text><text start="2336.84">Is there reasons to believe
it&amp;#39;s correct?</text><text start="2340.869">Turn now to the second basic
view, the physicalist view,</text><text start="2346.744">according to which a person is
just a body.</text><text start="2351.55">This is a materialist view.
People are just material</text><text start="2356.359">objects, the sorts of things
biologists poke and prod and</text><text start="2361.632">study.
It&amp;#39;s important--I think this is</text><text start="2365.179">the crucial point--that when we
say a person is just a body,</text><text start="2370.489">we don&amp;#39;t understand that to
mean--the physicalist doesn&amp;#39;t</text><text start="2375.892">mean that as--a person is just
any old body.</text><text start="2380.329">It&amp;#39;s not as though there aren&amp;#39;t
important differences between</text><text start="2384.186">different physical objects.
Some physical objects can do</text><text start="2388.41">things of a far more interesting
sort than other physical</text><text start="2393.132">objects.
Here&amp;#39;s a piece of chalk.</text><text start="2396.57">It&amp;#39;s a physical object.
It&amp;#39;s just a body.</text><text start="2400">What can it do?
Well, not a whole lot.</text><text start="2403.48">I can write on the board with
it.</text><text start="2405.41">I can break it in two.
You let go of it, it drops down.</text><text start="2410.21">Not a very interesting physical
body.</text><text start="2413.91">Here&amp;#39;s a cell phone.
It&amp;#39;s just a body.</text><text start="2417.719">It&amp;#39;s not the most interesting
physical object in the world,</text><text start="2421.016">but it&amp;#39;s a whole lot more
interesting than a piece of</text><text start="2423.971">chalk.
It can do all sorts of things a</text><text start="2427.761">piece of chalk can&amp;#39;t do.
If the physicalist is right,</text><text start="2433.255">then here&amp;#39;s another physical
object for you--me,</text><text start="2438.115">Shelly Kagan.
I&amp;#39;m a pretty impressive</text><text start="2442.167">physical object.
Now arrogant as I may be,</text><text start="2445.63">I don&amp;#39;t mean to suggest I&amp;#39;m any
more impressive than you guys</text><text start="2449.686">are.
Each one of us,</text><text start="2451.761">according to the physicalist,
is just a body that can do some</text><text start="2458.168">amazing things.
We are bodies that can think.</text><text start="2464.41">We are bodies that can plan.
We are bodies that can reason.</text><text start="2469.69">We are bodies that can feel.
We are bodies that can be</text><text start="2474.121">afraid and be creative and have
dreams and aspirations.</text><text start="2478.65">We are bodies that can
communicate with each other.</text><text start="2481.769">We are bodies that are--well,
here&amp;#39;s a word for it:</text><text start="2486.652">We&amp;#39;re bodies that are people.
But on the physicalist view,</text><text start="2492.775">a person is just a body.
And that&amp;#39;s where we&amp;#39;ll take it</text><text start="2497.217">up next time.
