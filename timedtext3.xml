by life under the sea?</text><text start="18.96" dur="1.376">Fantastic.</text><text start="20.36" dur="1.56">Now, what did we just do?</text><text start="22.76" dur="1.816">Let&amp;#39;s dissect this for a second.</text><text start="24.6" dur="3.496">The simple action
of an individual raising a hand</text><text start="28.12" dur="1.84">led many others to do the same.</text><text start="30.88" dur="3.336">Now, it&amp;#39;s true that when individuals
in a social network</text><text start="34.24" dur="1.576">have common priorities,</text><text start="35.84" dur="2.976">it&amp;#39;s often beneficial to copy one another.</text><text start="38.84" dur="3.856">Think back to grade school and dressing
like the cool kids made you &amp;quot;cool.&amp;quot;</text><text start="42.72" dur="3.696">But copying behavior
is also common in wild animals.</text><text start="46.44" dur="3.736">For example, some birds
copy the alarm calls of other birds</text><text start="50.2" dur="2.8">to spread information
about approaching predators.</text><text start="53.92" dur="3.256">But could copying behavior in wild animals</text><text start="57.2" dur="3.64">affect entire ecosystems
that we humans depend on?</text><text start="62.04" dur="2.576">I was led to this question
while studying coral reefs,</text><text start="64.64" dur="3.496">which support millions of people
through fisheries and tourism</text><text start="68.16" dur="2.576">here in Africa and around the world.</text><text start="70.76" dur="3.256">But coral reefs depend on fish</text><text start="74.04" dur="3.08">that perform a critical job
by eating algae.</text><text start="77.64" dur="1.256">Because if left unchecked,</text><text start="78.92" dur="3.896">these algae can kill coral
and take over entire coral reefs,</text><text start="82.84" dur="4.6">a costly change that is difficult
or impossible to reverse.</text><text start="88.16" dur="3.016">So to understand
how fish may prevent this,</text><text start="91.2" dur="1.936">I spy on them</text><text start="93.16" dur="2.056">while they&amp;#39;re eating algae,</text><text start="95.24" dur="2.056">which can be difficult for them to do</text><text start="97.32" dur="3.816">in open parts of the reef
exposed to predators,</text><text start="101.16" dur="1.776">some of which, on rare occasion,</text><text start="102.96" dur="2.4">appear to realize I&amp;#39;m watching them.</text><text start="105.88" dur="4.04">(Laughter)</text><text start="112.28" dur="3.056">So clearly, clearly, for reef fish,</text><text start="115.36" dur="2.336">dining out can be scary.</text><text start="117.72" dur="2.536">But I wanted to understand
how these fish do their job</text><text start="120.28" dur="1.576">in risky situations.</text><text start="121.88" dur="4.256">So my colleagues and I
put massive video camera stands</text><text start="126.16" dur="1.336">in a coral reef</text><text start="127.52" dur="2.696">to remotely monitor entire feeding grounds</text><text start="130.24" dur="1.576">that produce a lot of algae</text><text start="131.84" dur="2.76">but are exposed to predators.</text><text start="135.56" dur="2.136">And this perspective from above</text><text start="137.72" dur="3.496">shows us the feeding behavior
and precise movements</text><text start="141.24" dur="1.576">of many different fish,</text><text start="142.84" dur="1.64">shown here with colored dots.</text><text start="145.24" dur="2.896">And by analyzing
thousands of fish movements</text><text start="148.16" dur="2.216">to and from feeding grounds,</text><text start="150.4" dur="1.6">we discovered a pattern.</text><text start="152.68" dur="2.656">These fish, despite being
from different species</text><text start="155.36" dur="1.816">and not swimming in schools,</text><text start="157.2" dur="2.016">were copying one another,</text><text start="159.24" dur="3.216">such that one fish entering
these dangerous feeding grounds</text><text start="162.48" dur="2.4">could lead many others to do the same.</text><text start="165.32" dur="2.936">And fish stayed for longer
and ate more algae</text><text start="168.28" dur="3.016">when they were surrounded
by more feeding fish.</text><text start="171.32" dur="1.936">Now, this could be happening</text><text start="173.28" dur="2.576">because even simple movements
by individual fish</text><text start="175.88" dur="3.976">can inadvertently communicate
vital information.</text><text start="179.88" dur="3.976">For example, if even one fish
sees a predator and flees,</text><text start="183.88" dur="2.736">this can alert many others to danger.</text><text start="186.64" dur="3.92">And a fish safely entering feeding grounds
can show others that the coast is clear.</text><text start="191.32" dur="4.016">So it turns out that even when
these fish are different species,</text><text start="195.36" dur="3.616">they are connected within social networks</text><text start="199" dur="3">which can provide information
on when it&amp;#39;s safe to eat.</text><text start="202.84" dur="4.976">And our analyses indicate that fish simply
copying other fish in their social network</text><text start="207.84" dur="5.056">could account for over 60 percent
of the algae eaten by the fish community,</text><text start="212.92" dur="5.016">and thus could be critical
to the flow of energy and resources</text><text start="217.96" dur="2">through coral reef ecosystems.</text><text start="220.68" dur="2.576">But these findings also suggest
that overfishing,</text><text start="223.28" dur="1.976">a common problem in coral reefs,</text><text start="225.28" dur="2.456">not only removes fish,</text><text start="227.76" dur="3.056">but it could break up
the social network of remaining fish,</text><text start="230.84" dur="2.776">which may hide more and eat less algae</text><text start="233.64" dur="2.536">because they&amp;#39;re missing
critical information.</text><text start="236.2" dur="3.96">And this would make coral reefs
more vulnerable than we currently predict.</text><text start="242.04" dur="4.336">So remarkably, fish social networks</text><text start="246.4" dur="2.896">allow the actions of one to spread to many</text><text start="249.32" dur="1.936">and could affect entire coral reefs,</text><text start="251.28" dur="3.256">which feed millions of us</text><text start="254.56" dur="1.776">and support the global economy</text><text start="256.36" dur="1.48">for all of us.</text><text start="258.44" dur="2.696">Now, our discovery
points us towards better ways</text><text start="261.16" dur="2.176">to sustainably manage coral reefs,</text><text start="263.36" dur="1.576">but it also shows us,</text><text start="264.96" dur="4.176">we humans are not just affected
by the actions of other humans,</text><text start="269.16" dur="2.895">but we could be affected
by the actions of individual fish</text><text start="272.079" dur="1.777">on a distant coral reef</text><text start="273.88" dur="2.456">through their simple copying behavior.</text><text start="276.36" dur="1.216">Thank you.</text><text start="277.6" dur="4.72">(Applause)</text></transcript>
