the Taos Pueblo Hoop Dance,</text><text start="17.606" dur="4.131">a traditional dance born hundreds
of years ago in Southwestern USA.</text><text start="22.508" dur="2.92">A series of hoops are created
out of willow wood,</text><text start="25.452" dur="3.862">and they&amp;#39;re threaded together
to create formations of the natural world,</text><text start="29.338" dur="2.019">showing the many beauties of life.</text><text start="31.923" dur="2.982">In this dance, you&amp;#39;re circling
in a constant spin,</text><text start="34.929" dur="2.062">mimicking the movement of the Sun</text><text start="37.015" dur="1.647">and the passage of time.</text><text start="40.232" dur="3.259">Watching this dance was magic to me.</text><text start="43.515" dur="1.358">Like with a time capsule,</text><text start="44.897" dur="3.28">I was taking a look through
a cultural window to the past.</text><text start="48.201" dur="1.908">I felt a deeper connection</text><text start="50.133" dur="3.303">to how my ancestors used to look
at the world around them.</text><text start="54.046" dur="3.749">Since then, I&amp;#39;ve always been
obsessed with time capsules.</text><text start="57.819" dur="1.628">They take on many forms,</text><text start="59.471" dur="3.085">but the common thread
is that they&amp;#39;re uncontrollably fascinating</text><text start="62.58" dur="2.122">to us as human beings,</text><text start="64.726" dur="2.166">because they&amp;#39;re portals to a memory,</text><text start="66.916" dur="3.814">and they hold the important power
of keeping stories alive.</text><text start="71.503" dur="2.109">As a filmmaker and composer,</text><text start="73.636" dur="2.579">it&amp;#39;s been my journey to find my voice,</text><text start="76.239" dur="3.369">reclaim the stories
of my heritage and the past</text><text start="79.632" dur="4.062">and infuse them into music and film
time capsules to share.</text><text start="84.838" dur="2.326">To tell you a bit about
how I found my voice,</text><text start="87.188" dur="2.27">I&amp;#39;d like to share a bit
about how I grew up.</text><text start="89.88" dur="3.392">In Southern California, I grew up
in a multigenerational home,</text><text start="93.296" dur="1.89">meaning I lived under the same roof</text><text start="95.21" dur="3.282">as my parents, aunts,
uncles and grandparents.</text><text start="98.936" dur="4.623">My mother is Dutch-Indonesian and Chinese
with immigrant parents,</text><text start="103.583" dur="1.986">and my father is Ojibwe</text><text start="105.593" dur="1.604">and an enrolled tribal member</text><text start="107.221" dur="3.39">of the Prairie Band&amp;#39;s Potawatomi Tribe
in Northeastern Kansas.</text><text start="111.238" dur="2.98">So one weekend I&amp;#39;d be learning
how to fold dumplings,</text><text start="114.242" dur="2.305">and the next, I&amp;#39;d be
traditional-style dancing</text><text start="116.571" dur="1.197">at a powwow,</text><text start="117.792" dur="3.378">immersed in the powerful sounds
of drums and singers.</text><text start="122.405" dur="2.606">Being surrounded by many
cultures was the norm,</text><text start="125.035" dur="2.867">but also a very confusing experience.</text><text start="128.5" dur="2.189">It was really hard for me
to find my voice,</text><text start="130.713" dur="2.242">because I never felt I was enough --</text><text start="132.979" dur="3.843">never Chinese, Dutch-Indonesian
or Native enough.</text><text start="137.381" dur="3.051">Because I never felt I was a part
of any community,</text><text start="140.456" dur="3.433">I sought to learn
the stories of my heritage</text><text start="143.913" dur="2.769">and connect them together
to rediscover my own.</text><text start="147.254" dur="3.711">The first medium I felt
gave me a voice was music.</text><text start="152.043" dur="3.182">With layers of sounds
and multiple instruments,</text><text start="155.249" dur="3.658">I could create soundscapes and worlds
that were much bigger than my own.</text><text start="159.556" dur="2.88">Through music, I&amp;#39;m inviting you
into a sonic portal</text><text start="162.46" dur="2.002">of my memories and emotions,</text><text start="164.486" dur="2.183">and I&amp;#39;m holding up a mirror to yours.</text><text start="167.538" dur="3.2">One of my favorite instruments to play
is the guzheng zither,</text><text start="170.762" dur="1.954">a Chinese harp-like instrument.</text><text start="173.19" dur="2.304">While the hoop dance
is hundreds of years old,</text><text start="175.518" dur="3.795">the guzheng has more
than 2,000 years of history.</text><text start="179.337" dur="2.675">I&amp;#39;m playing the styles that greatly
influence me today,</text><text start="182.036" dur="1.637">like electronic music,</text><text start="183.697" dur="3.982">with an instrument that was used
to play traditional folk music long ago.</text><text start="188.235" dur="2.818">And I noticed an interesting connection:</text><text start="191.077" dur="2.431">the zither is tuned
to the pentatonic scale,</text><text start="193.532" dur="3.552">a scale that is universally known
in so many parts of music</text><text start="197.108" dur="1.185">around the world,</text><text start="198.317" dur="2.813">including Native American folk songs.</text><text start="201.781" dur="1.922">In both Chinese and Native folk,</text><text start="203.727" dur="4.257">I sense this inherent sound of longing
and holding onto the past,</text><text start="208.008" dur="3.395">an emotion that greatly drives
the music I create today.</text><text start="212.603" dur="3.538">At the time, I wondered if I could make
this feeling of immersion</text><text start="216.165" dur="1.158">even more powerful,</text><text start="217.347" dur="2.212">by layering visuals and music --</text><text start="219.583" dur="2.747">visuals and images on top of the music.</text><text start="222.87" dur="3.578">So I turned to internet tutorials
to learn editing software,</text><text start="226.472" dur="2.097">went to community college to save money</text><text start="228.593" dur="1.32">and created films.</text><text start="231.012" dur="1.739">After a few years experimenting,</text><text start="232.775" dur="3.398">I was 17 and had something
I wanted to tell and preserve.</text><text start="236.197" dur="1.628">It started with a question:</text><text start="238.692" dur="3.07">What happens when a story is forgotten?</text><text start="242.985" dur="2.67">I lead with this in my latest
documentary film,</text><text start="245.679" dur="1.517">&amp;quot;Smoke That Travels,&amp;quot;</text><text start="247.22" dur="5.285">which immerses people into the world
of music, song, color and dance,</text><text start="252.529" dur="5.312">as I explore my fear that a part
of my identity, my Native heritage,</text><text start="257.865" dur="2.005">will be forgotten in time.</text><text start="260.728" dur="4.489">Many indigenous languages are dying
due to historically forced assimilation.</text><text start="265.619" dur="3.618">From the late 1800s to the early 1970s,</text><text start="269.261" dur="2.435">Natives were forced into boarding schools,</text><text start="271.72" dur="3.596">where they were violently punished
if they practiced traditional ways</text><text start="275.34" dur="1.722">or spoke their native language,</text><text start="277.086" dur="2.231">most of which were orally passed down.</text><text start="279.892" dur="5.675">As of now, there are 567 federally
recognized tribes in the United States,</text><text start="285.591" dur="1.861">when there used to be countless more.</text><text start="288.179" dur="1.6">In my father&amp;#39;s words,</text><text start="289.803" dur="3.559">&amp;quot;Being Native is not about
wearing long hair in braids.</text><text start="293.386" dur="2.416">It&amp;#39;s not about feathers or beadwork.</text><text start="296.244" dur="4.39">It&amp;#39;s about the way we all center ourselves
in the world as human beings.&amp;quot;</text><text start="301.776" dur="2.299">After traveling with this film
for over a year,</text><text start="304.099" dur="2.401">I met indigenous people
from around the world,</text><text start="306.524" dur="1.629">from the Ainu of Japan,</text><text start="308.177" dur="1.45">Sami of Scandinavia,</text><text start="309.651" dur="1.175">the Maori</text><text start="310.85" dur="1.234">and many more.</text><text start="312.108" dur="3.859">And they were all dealing
with the exact same struggle</text><text start="315.991" dur="2.06">to preserve their language and culture.</text><text start="319.168" dur="3.59">At this moment, I not only realize
the power storytelling has</text><text start="322.782" dur="2.392">to connect all of us as human beings</text><text start="325.198" dur="2.805">but the responsibility
that comes with this power.</text><text start="328.48" dur="4.298">It can become incredibly dangerous
when our stories are rewritten or ignored,</text><text start="332.802" dur="1.986">because when we are denied identity,</text><text start="334.812" dur="1.541">we become invisible.</text><text start="336.89" dur="2.153">We&amp;#39;re all storytellers.</text><text start="339.705" dur="4.636">Reclaiming our narratives
and just listening to each other&amp;#39;s</text><text start="344.365" dur="3.452">can create a portal
that can transcend time itself.</text><text start="348.397" dur="1.183">Thank you.</text><text start="349.604" dur="3.348">(Applause)</text></transcript>
