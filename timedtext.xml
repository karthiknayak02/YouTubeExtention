<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="12.881" dur="2.713">Imagine with me this scene.</text><text start="16.889" dur="4.798">It&amp;#39;s a scene that played out
in nearly all of our families.</text><text start="22.633" dur="3.396">It&amp;#39;s a scene in which a young person,</text><text start="26.053" dur="2.961">somewhere in our family tree,</text><text start="29.038" dur="2.452">somewhere in our lineage</text><text start="31.514" dur="2.533">had a heartbreaking decision to make.</text><text start="35.776" dur="3.89">It was a decision to leave all
that they had known.</text><text start="40.45" dur="3.548">And all of the people that they had loved</text><text start="44.022" dur="3.992">and to set out for a place far, far away</text><text start="48.038" dur="2.095">that they had never seen</text><text start="50.157" dur="2.333">in hopes that life might be better.</text><text start="53.625" dur="4.878">Migration is usually
a young person&amp;#39;s endeavor.</text><text start="59.196" dur="3.619">It&amp;#39;s the kind of thing that you do
when you&amp;#39;re on the cusp of life.</text><text start="63.355" dur="4.025">And so, there is, in all of our families,</text><text start="67.404" dur="3.135">this young person
somewhere in our background.</text><text start="71.641" dur="3.23">That person is standing at a dock,</text><text start="74.895" dur="1.849">about to board a ship</text><text start="76.768" dur="3.4">that will cross the Atlantic
or the Pacific Ocean.</text><text start="80.823" dur="3.302">That person is loading up a truck</text><text start="84.149" dur="2">that will cross the Rio Grande.</text><text start="87.165" dur="2.904">Or that person is standing</text><text start="90.093" dur="2.302">at a railroad platform</text><text start="92.419" dur="5.984">about to board a train
that will cross rivers and mountains</text><text start="98.427" dur="2.19">out of the Jim Crow South</text><text start="100.641" dur="3.425">to what they hope
will be freedom in the North.</text><text start="105.665" dur="2.936">And there, with this young person</text><text start="110.013" dur="3.985">as they are about to board that ship,</text><text start="114.022" dur="1.42">that boat,</text><text start="115.466" dur="3.262">that truck, that train,</text><text start="118.752" dur="2.412">are the people who raised them.</text><text start="121.946" dur="2.904">Their mother, their father,</text><text start="124.874" dur="3.849">their aunt, their uncle,
their grandparents,</text><text start="128.747" dur="3.777">whoever it might have been
who had gotten them to this point.</text><text start="133.469" dur="1.159">Those older people</text><text start="134.652" dur="3.42">were not going to be able
to make the crossing with them.</text><text start="139.247" dur="5.29">And as they looked into the eyes
of the people who had raised them,</text><text start="144.561" dur="2.31">there was no guarantee</text><text start="146.895" dur="3.221">that they would ever see them alive again.</text><text start="151.91" dur="2.969">Remember, there was no Skype,</text><text start="154.903" dur="3.515">no e-mail, no cell phones</text><text start="158.442" dur="2.968">not even reliable long-distance
telephone service.</text><text start="161.909" dur="1.976">And even if there had been,</text><text start="163.909" dur="5.287">many of the people that they were leaving
did not even have telephones.</text><text start="169.22" dur="3.103">This was going to be a complete break</text><text start="172.347" dur="2.071">from all that they knew</text><text start="174.442" dur="2.714">and all of the people that they loved.</text><text start="177.18" dur="2.024">And the very next time</text><text start="179.228" dur="5.381">that they might hear anything
about the people who had raised them</text><text start="184.633" dur="5.03">might be a telegram saying,
&amp;quot;Your father has passed away.&amp;quot;</text><text start="191.427" dur="2.904">Or, &amp;quot;Your mother is very, very ill.</text><text start="195.053" dur="5.238">You must return home quickly
if you are to see her alive again.&amp;quot;</text><text start="201.828" dur="3.723">That is the magnitude of the sacrifice</text><text start="205.575" dur="4.444">that had to have happened
in nearly all of our families</text><text start="210.043" dur="1.533">just for us to be here.</text><text start="212.565" dur="5.254">A single decision
that changed the course of families</text><text start="217.843" dur="4.079">and lineages and countries and history</text><text start="221.946" dur="1.267">to the current day.</text><text start="225.308" dur="2.587">One of these migration streams</text><text start="227.919" dur="2.841">stands out in ways
that we may not realize.</text><text start="231.863" dur="2.267">It was called the Great Migration.</text><text start="234.839" dur="5.555">It was the outpouring
of six million African Americans</text><text start="240.418" dur="2.087">from the Jim Crow South</text><text start="242.529" dur="2.754">to the cities of the North and West,</text><text start="245.307" dur="3.611">from the time of World War I
until the 1970s.</text><text start="250.109" dur="6.682">It stands out because this
was the first time in American history</text><text start="256.815" dur="6.217">that American citizens
had to flee the land of their birth</text><text start="263.056" dur="4.12">just to be recognized as the citizens
that they had always been.</text><text start="268.022" dur="2.254">No other group of Americans</text><text start="270.3" dur="3.078">has had to act like immigrants</text><text start="274.696" dur="2.198">in order to be recognized as citizens.</text><text start="277.864" dur="3.943">So this great migration was not a move.</text><text start="283.043" dur="4.145">It was actually a seeking
of political asylum</text><text start="287.212" dur="2.667">within the borders of one&amp;#39;s own country.</text><text start="291.704" dur="4.364">They were defecting a caste system
known as Jim Crow.</text><text start="297.545" dur="1.897">It was an artificial hierarchy</text><text start="299.466" dur="4">in which everything
that you could and could not do</text><text start="303.49" dur="2.4">was based upon what you looked like.</text><text start="307.49" dur="4.603">This caste system was so arcane
that it was actually against the law</text><text start="312.117" dur="3.166">for a black person and a white person</text><text start="315.307" dur="3.778">to merely play checkers
together in Birmingham.</text><text start="319.109" dur="1.857">You could go to jail</text><text start="320.99" dur="3.65">if you were caught playing checkers
with a person of a different race.</text><text start="325.244" dur="4.762">Someone must have seen
a black person and a white person</text><text start="330.03" dur="3.603">playing checkers with someone
in some town square.</text><text start="333.657" dur="3.444">And maybe the wrong person was winning</text><text start="337.125" dur="2.492">or they were having too good of a time,</text><text start="339.641" dur="2.723">but whatever it was that this person saw,</text><text start="342.388" dur="2.943">with this black person
and this white person playing checkers,</text><text start="345.355" dur="4.682">they felt the entire foundation
of Southern civilization was in peril.</text><text start="350.061" dur="2.707">And decided that it was worth
taking the time</text><text start="352.792" dur="2.142">to write this down as a law.</text><text start="356.149" dur="2.675">This caste system was so arcane</text><text start="358.848" dur="5.872">that in courtrooms throughout the South
there was actually a black Bible</text><text start="364.744" dur="3.231">and an altogether separate white Bible</text><text start="367.999" dur="2.757">to swear to tell the truth on in court.</text><text start="372.328" dur="2.805">The very word of God was segregated</text><text start="375.157" dur="3.031">in the caste system of the Jim Crow South.</text><text start="380.339" dur="3.167">The same sacred object</text><text start="383.53" dur="3.293">could not be touched
by hands of different races.</text><text start="388.831" dur="2.092">This artificial hierarchy,</text><text start="391.981" dur="4.271">because it goes against
human desires to be free,</text><text start="397.597" dur="4.381">required a tremendous amount
of violence to maintain.</text><text start="402.557" dur="4.449">Such that every four days,
somewhere in the American South,</text><text start="407.03" dur="3.206">every four days
an African American was lynched</text><text start="410.26" dur="4.547">for some perceived breach of protocol
in this caste system</text><text start="414.831" dur="4.2">in the decades leading up
to the start of the Great Migration.</text><text start="420.776" dur="4.102">This caste system had been put in place
for many, many reasons.</text><text start="425.252" dur="4.576">But one of them was to maintain
the economic order of the South,</text><text start="430.395" dur="4.031">which required not just
a supply of cheap labor</text><text start="434.45" dur="4.762">but an oversupply of cheap labor
to work at the will of the land.</text><text start="440.77" dur="5.444">This Great Migration began
when the North had a labor problem.</text><text start="446.691" dur="1.493">The North had a labor problem</text><text start="448.208" dur="3.306">because it had been relying
on cheap labor from Europe --</text><text start="451.538" dur="1.301">immigrants from Europe --</text><text start="452.863" dur="3.459">to work the factories and the foundries
and the steel mills.</text><text start="456.346" dur="2.493">But during World War I,</text><text start="458.863" dur="3.293">migration from Europe
came to a virtual halt.</text><text start="462.18" dur="2.517">And so the North had a labor problem.</text><text start="464.721" dur="5.785">And so the North decided to go
and find the cheapest labor in the land</text><text start="470.53" dur="2.88">which meant African Americans
in the South,</text><text start="473.434" dur="3.699">many of whom were not even being paid
for their hard work.</text><text start="477.157" dur="1.349">Many of them were working</text><text start="478.53" dur="3.372">for the right to live on the land
that they were farming.</text><text start="481.926" dur="2.627">They were sharecroppers
and not even being paid.</text><text start="484.577" dur="2.267">So they were ripe for recruitment.</text><text start="487.482" dur="1.897">But it turned out</text><text start="489.403" dur="4.808">that the South did not take kindly
to this poaching of its cheap labor.</text><text start="494.871" dur="4.165">The South actually did everything it could
to keep the people from leaving.</text><text start="499.06" dur="3.787">They would arrest people
from the railroad platforms.</text><text start="502.871" dur="3.436">Remember, putatively free
American citizens.</text><text start="506.895" dur="2.388">They would arrest them
from their train seats.</text><text start="509.839" dur="2.548">And when there were too many
people to arrest,</text><text start="512.411" dur="2.285">they would wave the train on through</text><text start="514.72" dur="2.294">so that people who had been hoping</text><text start="517.038" dur="1.238">and saving</text><text start="518.3" dur="3.237">and praying for the chance
to get to freedom</text><text start="521.561" dur="3.365">had to figure out:
How now will we get out?</text><text start="526.211" dur="3.357">And as they made their way
out of the South,</text><text start="529.592" dur="2.476">away from Jim Crow,</text><text start="532.092" dur="3.409">they followed three
beautifully predictable streams</text><text start="535.525" dur="4.559">as is the case in any migration
throughout human history.</text><text start="540.541" dur="3.144">In this particular case,
there were three streams.</text><text start="543.709" dur="4.869">One was the migration along the East Coast</text><text start="548.602" dur="4.22">from Florida, Georgia,
the Carolinas and Virginia</text><text start="552.846" dur="2.858">to Washington DC, to Philadelphia,</text><text start="555.728" dur="3.468">New Jersey, New York
and on up the East coast.</text><text start="559.22" dur="1.611">There was the Midwest stream,</text><text start="560.855" dur="3.889">which carried people
from Mississippi, Alabama,</text><text start="564.768" dur="2.214">Tennessee and Arkansas</text><text start="567.006" dur="4.655">to Chicago, to Detroit,
to Cleveland and the entire Midwest.</text><text start="571.961" dur="2.191">And then there was the West Coast stream,</text><text start="574.176" dur="3.973">which carried people
from Louisiana and Texas</text><text start="578.173" dur="1.428">out to California.</text><text start="579.966" dur="2.444">And when they really wanted to get away,</text><text start="582.434" dur="1.627">they went to Seattle.</text><text start="584.085" dur="3.842">And when they really, really
wanted to get away,</text><text start="587.951" dur="1.725">they went to Alaska,</text><text start="589.7" dur="4.257">the farthest possible point
within the borders of the United States</text><text start="593.981" dur="1.563">from Jim Crow South.</text><text start="597.941" dur="2.429">Before the Great Migration began,</text><text start="600.394" dur="4.413">90 percent of all African Americans
were living in the South.</text><text start="604.831" dur="2.833">Nearly held captive in the South.</text><text start="608.276" dur="3.19">But by the time
this Great Migration was over,</text><text start="611.49" dur="3.452">nearly half were living
all over the rest of the country.</text><text start="614.966" dur="3.578">So this ended up being
nearly a complete redistribution</text><text start="618.569" dur="2.214">of part of an entire people.</text><text start="623.037" dur="5.166">This Great Migration was the first time
in American history</text><text start="628.228" dur="2.925">that the lowest caste people</text><text start="631.326" dur="3.761">signaled that they had options
and were willing to take them.</text><text start="636.227" dur="4.449">That had not happened
in the three centuries</text><text start="640.701" dur="5.169">in which African Americans
had been on that soil at that time.</text><text start="646.707" dur="4.417">It had not happened
in 12 generations of enslavement</text><text start="651.148" dur="3.05">that preceded
nearly a century of Jim Crow.</text><text start="655.489" dur="2.46">How many &amp;quot;greats&amp;quot;</text><text start="657.973" dur="3.23">do you have to add
to the word &amp;quot;grandparent&amp;quot;</text><text start="661.227" dur="6.097">to begin to imagine how long
enslavement lasted in the United States?</text><text start="668.715" dur="6.262">Secondly, this Great Migration
was the first time in American history</text><text start="675.001" dur="2.861">that the lowest caste people</text><text start="677.886" dur="4.985">actually had a chance
to choose for themselves</text><text start="682.895" dur="3.332">what they would do
with their God-given talents</text><text start="686.251" dur="1.92">and where they would pursue them.</text><text start="689.84" dur="2.785">Think about those cotton fields</text><text start="692.649" dur="2.127">and those rice plantations</text><text start="694.8" dur="2.016">and those tobacco fields</text><text start="696.84" dur="1.867">and those sugar plantations.</text><text start="699.41" dur="2.254">On those sugar plantations,</text><text start="701.688" dur="2.357">and on those tobacco fields,</text><text start="704.069" dur="2.333">and on those rice plantations,</text><text start="706.426" dur="2.142">and on those cotton fields</text><text start="708.592" dur="2.087">were opera singers,</text><text start="710.703" dur="2.032">jazz musicians,</text><text start="712.759" dur="1.775">playwrights,</text><text start="714.558" dur="1.658">novelists,</text><text start="716.24" dur="1.667">surgeons,</text><text start="717.931" dur="1.698">attorneys,</text><text start="719.653" dur="1.587">accountants,</text><text start="721.264" dur="1.714">professors,</text><text start="723.002" dur="1.15">journalists.</text><text start="724.653" dur="1.39">And how do we know that?</text><text start="726.533" dur="4.845">We know that because that is
what they and their children</text><text start="731.402" dur="3.883">and now their grandchildren
and even great-grandchildren</text><text start="735.309" dur="2.196">have often chosen to become</text><text start="737.529" dur="4.206">once they had the chance
to choose for themselves</text><text start="741.759" dur="2.666">what they would do
with their God-given talents.</text><text start="745.402" dur="2.439">Without the Great Migration,</text><text start="747.865" dur="4.658">there might not have been
a Toni Morrison as we now know her to be.</text><text start="753.451" dur="3.199">Her parents were from Alabama
and from Georgia.</text><text start="756.674" dur="2.001">They migrated to Ohio,</text><text start="758.699" dur="2.171">where their daughter
would get to do something</text><text start="760.894" dur="2.841">that we all take for granted
at this point,</text><text start="763.759" dur="4.539">but which was against the law
and against protocol for African Americans</text><text start="768.322" dur="2.874">at the time that she would have been
growing up in the South,</text><text start="771.22" dur="1.182">had they stayed.</text><text start="772.426" dur="2.611">And that is just to walk into a library</text><text start="775.061" dur="2.095">and take out a library book.</text><text start="777.18" dur="3.976">Merely by making
the single decision to leave,</text><text start="781.18" dur="4.039">her parents assured that their daughter
would get access to books.</text><text start="785.727" dur="2.738">And if you&amp;#39;re going to become
a Nobel laureate,</text><text start="788.489" dur="1.944">it helps to get a book now and then.</text><text start="790.457" dur="1.267">You know, it helps.</text><text start="793.505" dur="4.391">Music as we know it was reshaped
by the Great Migration.</text><text start="799.434" dur="2.491">As they came North,
they brought with them,</text><text start="801.949" dur="2.707">on their hearts and in their memories,</text><text start="804.68" dur="3.094">the music that had sustained
the ancestors --</text><text start="807.798" dur="3.897">the blues music, the spirituals
and the gospel music</text><text start="811.719" dur="2.444">that had sustained them
through the generations.</text><text start="814.751" dur="4.27">And they converted this music
into whole new genres of music.</text><text start="819.045" dur="3.008">And got the chance to record this music,</text><text start="822.077" dur="2.079">this new music that they were creating,</text><text start="824.18" dur="2.142">and to spread it throughout the world.</text><text start="827.807" dur="3.388">Without the Great Migration,
&amp;quot;Motown&amp;quot; would not have existed.</text><text start="831.843" dur="2.976">The founder, Berry Gordy,
his parents were from Georgia.</text><text start="834.843" dur="1.603">They migrated to Detroit.</text><text start="836.47" dur="3.694">And when he got to be a grown man,
he decided he wanted to go into music.</text><text start="840.188" dur="3.372">But he didn&amp;#39;t have the wherewithal
to go all over the country</text><text start="843.584" dur="1.58">looking for the best talent,</text><text start="845.188" dur="2.265">and it turned out he didn&amp;#39;t have to.</text><text start="847.477" dur="1.909">It turned out that there he was,</text><text start="849.41" dur="3.023">surrounded by children
of the Great Migration</text><text start="852.457" dur="3.404">whose parents had brought this music up
with them during the journey.</text><text start="856.822" dur="3.453">And among those children
were these three girls,</text><text start="860.299" dur="1.886">there was Mary Wilson,</text><text start="863.292" dur="1.326">Florence Ballard</text><text start="865.405" dur="1.407">and there was a third one:</text><text start="867.478" dur="1.15">Diana Ross.</text><text start="869.111" dur="4.789">We might not know Diana Ross&amp;#39; name
had there been no Great Migration.</text><text start="873.925" dur="3.665">Because like a lot of Americans
and a lot of human beings in general,</text><text start="877.614" dur="2.852">she might not have existed
because her parents might not have met.</text><text start="880.769" dur="2.206">Her mother was from Alabama,</text><text start="882.999" dur="1.746">father from West Virginia,</text><text start="884.769" dur="3.403">they migrated to Detroit, different years,</text><text start="888.196" dur="3.167">met, married, had her and her siblings,</text><text start="891.387" dur="2.349">and thus a legend was born.</text><text start="894.705" dur="3.778">Jazz was a creation
of the Great Migration.</text><text start="898.507" dur="3.666">And one of the greatest gifts
of the Great Migration.</text><text start="902.197" dur="3.629">Starting with Louis Armstrong,
who was born in Louisiana</text><text start="906.243" dur="4.016">and migrated on the Illinois
