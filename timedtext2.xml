<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?><transcript><text start="12.88" dur="3.216">The two places</text><text start="16.12" dur="3.48">where I feel most free</text><text start="20.68" dur="2.256">aren&amp;#39;t actually places.</text><text start="22.96" dur="1.44">They&amp;#39;re moments.</text><text start="25.64" dur="3.12">The first is inside of dance.</text><text start="29.36" dur="3.216">Somewhere between
rising up against gravity</text><text start="32.6" dur="3.496">and the feeling that the air beneath me</text><text start="36.12" dur="2.68">is falling in love with my body&amp;#39;s weight.</text><text start="39.76" dur="3.936">I&amp;#39;m dancing and the air is carrying me</text><text start="43.72" dur="1.72">like I might never come down.</text><text start="46.92" dur="1.856">The second place that I feel free</text><text start="48.8" dur="3.096">is after scoring a goal
on the soccer pitch.</text><text start="51.92" dur="2.616">My body floods with the chemical</text><text start="54.56" dur="3.096">that they put inside of EpiPens
to revive the dead,</text><text start="57.68" dur="3.04">and I am weightless,</text><text start="61.44" dur="2.04">raceless.</text><text start="64.84" dur="4.056">My story is this: I&amp;#39;m a curator
at a contemporary arts center,</text><text start="68.92" dur="6.28">but I don&amp;#39;t really believe in art
that doesn&amp;#39;t bleed or sweat or cry.</text><text start="76" dur="2.616">I imagine that my kids
are going to live in a time</text><text start="78.64" dur="4.08">when the most valuable commodities
are fresh water and empathy.</text><text start="83.56" dur="2.416">I love pretty dances
and majestic sculpture</text><text start="86" dur="1.656">as much as the next guy,</text><text start="87.68" dur="2.2">but give me something else to go with it.</text><text start="90.48" dur="2.656">Lift me up with the aesthetic sublime</text><text start="93.16" dur="4.696">and give me a practice or some tools
to turn that inspiration</text><text start="97.88" dur="2.08">into understanding and action.</text><text start="101.16" dur="4.976">For instance, I&amp;#39;m a theater maker
who loves sports.</text><text start="106.16" dur="2.256">When I was making
my latest piece /peh-LO-tah/</text><text start="108.44" dur="4.616">I thought a lot about how soccer
was a means for my own immigrant family</text><text start="113.08" dur="4.816">to foster a sense of continuity
and normality and community</text><text start="117.92" dur="2.44">within the new context of the US.</text><text start="121.24" dur="5.056">In this heightened moment of xenophobia
and assault on immigrant identity,</text><text start="126.32" dur="1.576">I wanted to think through</text><text start="127.92" dur="4.056">how the game could serve
as an affirmational tool</text><text start="132" dur="3.496">for first-generation Americans
and immigrant kids,</text><text start="135.52" dur="3.416">to ask them to consider
movement patterns on the field</text><text start="138.96" dur="5.28">as kin to migratory patterns
across social and political borders.</text><text start="144.88" dur="1.496">Whether footballers or not,</text><text start="146.4" dur="3.48">immigrants in the US
play on endangered ground.</text><text start="150.88" dur="1.856">I wanted to help the kids understand</text><text start="152.76" dur="3.856">that the same muscle
that they use to plan the next goal</text><text start="156.64" dur="3.16">can also be used
to navigate the next block.</text><text start="161.16" dur="3.52">For me, freedom exists in the body.</text><text start="165.24" dur="2.776">We talk about it abstractly
and even divisively,</text><text start="168.04" dur="3.776">like &amp;quot;protect our freedom,&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;build this wall,&amp;quot;</text><text start="171.84" dur="2">&amp;quot;they hate us because of our freedom.&amp;quot;</text><text start="174.4" dur="3.416">We have all these systems
that are beautifully designed</text><text start="177.84" dur="2.696">to incarcerate us or deport us,</text><text start="180.56" dur="3.04">but how do we design freedom?</text><text start="184.68" dur="4.176">For these kids, I wanted to track the idea
back to something that exists inside</text><text start="188.88" dur="1.376">that no one could take away,</text><text start="190.28" dur="1.736">so I developed this curriculum</text><text start="192.04" dur="4.936">that&amp;#39;s part poli-sci class,
part soccer tournament,</text><text start="197" dur="2.44">inside of an arts festival.</text><text start="200.24" dur="3.656">It accesses /peh-LO-tah/&amp;#39;s
field of inquiry</text><text start="203.92" dur="3.896">to create a sports-based
political action for young people.</text><text start="207.84" dur="2.696">The project is called
&amp;quot;Moving and Passing.&amp;quot;</text><text start="210.56" dur="4.136">It intersects curriculum development,
site-specific performance</text><text start="214.72" dur="1.896">and the politics of joy,</text><text start="216.64" dur="4.136">while using soccer as a metaphor
for the urgent question</text><text start="220.8" dur="2.36">of enfranchisement among immigrant youth.</text><text start="224.12" dur="3.776">Imagine that you are
a 15-year-old kid from Honduras</text><text start="227.92" dur="1.776">now living in Harlem,</text><text start="229.72" dur="4.896">or you&amp;#39;re a 13-year-old girl born in DC
to two Nigerian immigrants.</text><text start="234.64" dur="1.336">You love the game.</text><text start="236" dur="1.816">You&amp;#39;re on the field with your folks.</text><text start="237.84" dur="2.416">You&amp;#39;ve just been practicing
dribbling through cones</text><text start="240.28" dur="1.256">for, like, 15 minutes,</text><text start="241.56" dur="3.88">and then, all of a sudden,
a marching band comes down the field.</text><text start="246.36" dur="4.736">I want to associate the joy of the game
with the exuberance of culture,</text><text start="251.12" dur="4.496">to locate the site of joy in the game</text><text start="255.64" dur="2.536">at the same physical coordinate</text><text start="258.2" dur="3.856">as being politically informed by art,</text><text start="262.08" dur="3.36">a grass-laden theater for liberation.</text><text start="265.84" dur="1.216">We spend a week</text><text start="267.08" dur="3.536">looking at how the midfielder
would explain Black Lives Matter,</text><text start="270.64" dur="3.175">or how the goalkeeper
would explain gun control,</text><text start="273.839" dur="4.177">or how a defender&amp;#39;s style
is the perfect metaphor</text><text start="278.04" dur="2.736">for the limits of American exceptionalism.</text><text start="280.8" dur="2.056">As we study positions on the field,</text><text start="282.88" dur="4.12">we also name and imagine our own freedoms.</text><text start="288.72" dur="1.736">I don&amp;#39;t know, man, soccer is, like,</text><text start="290.48" dur="4.536">the only thing on this planet
that we can all agree to do together.</text><text start="295.04" dur="4.12">You know? It&amp;#39;s like the official sport
of this spinning ball.</text><text start="300" dur="5.096">I want to be able
to connect the joy of the game</text><text start="305.12" dur="3.256">to the ever-moving footballer,</text><text start="308.4" dur="2.136">to connect that moving footballer</text><text start="310.56" dur="4.48">to immigrants who also moved
in sight of a better position.</text><text start="315.72" dur="3.656">Among these kids, I want
to connect their families&amp;#39; histories</text><text start="319.4" dur="2.656">to the bliss of a goal-scorer&amp;#39;s run,</text><text start="322.08" dur="4.016">family like that feeling
after the ball beats the goalie,</text><text start="326.12" dur="2.88">the closest thing going to freedom.</text><text start="330" dur="1.216">Thank you.</text><text start="331.24" dur="5.48">(Applause)</text></transcript>
