On the morning of August the 9th 1945</text><text start="78.99" dur="3.709">air-raid sirens began to ring out in the Japanese city of Nagasaki</text><text start="83.64" dur="3.349">However a short while later the sirens rang out again</text><text start="88.04" dur="6.18">Indicating that there was no danger and people began to climb out of their shelters to carry on about their daily business</text><text start="95.8" dur="4.88">Japanese spotters had only cited two us AAF b-29 bombers</text><text start="101.34" dur="5.12">Not enough for an air raid on a major city and presumed, they were merely on a reconnaissance mission.</text><text start="107.72" dur="5">At 1101 hours a single bomb was dropped into the city&amp;#39;s industrial area</text><text start="113.22" dur="4.48">the bomb detonated with the equivalent force of 22,000 sticks of TNT</text><text start="118.62" dur="4.94">Which resulted in a blast so bright that was seen by observers over a hundred miles away.</text><text start="124.94" dur="5.22">the fireball generated temperatures in excess of three thousand nine hundred degrees centigrade and</text><text start="130.739" dur="3.83">Generated winds of up to six hundred miles per hour that added to the destruction</text><text start="135.84" dur="2.24">exact figures are unclear, but at least</text><text start="138.54" dur="6.52">129 thousand people were either killed on the day, or would die in the weeks and even years that followed</text><text start="146.31" dur="1.829">six days after this attack</text><text start="148.139" dur="2">Japan surrendered to the Allies</text><text start="150.269" dur="3.41">Bringing to a close the most destructive conflict ever recorded</text><text start="154.019" dur="4.67">that ended with the first two and so far only nuclear attacks in history</text><text start="159.569" dur="2.27">It was the Second World War</text><text start="169.05" dur="3.08">It&amp;#39;s impossible to disect the causes of the second world war</text><text start="172.65" dur="5.029">without discussing the rise of the Nazi Party in Germany and its leader, Adolf Hitler</text><text start="178.65" dur="4.999">Hitler was himself of Austrian birth, but he fought in the German army during the first world war</text><text start="184.62" dur="4.94">When the war ended with Germany&amp;#39;s humiliation Hitler felt especially bitter about it</text><text start="190.02" dur="4.16">unlike many in Europe he feared communism spreading beyond the borders of</text><text start="194.52" dur="2.42">post-revolutionary Russia</text><text start="196.95" dur="6.26">In 1919 a year after the end of the war he joined a new and little-known political group</text><text start="203.55" dur="6.979">called the German Workers Party and used his great ability as a speaker to stir up crowds and gain support a</text><text start="211.29" dur="4.489">Year later the party was renamed the National Socialist, German Workers Party</text><text start="216.5" dur="3.74">more commonly known by its English abbreviation Nazi</text><text start="221.5" dur="8.52">In 1921 Hitler rose to become leader of the party and again using his magnetic personality he continued to garner more and more support</text><text start="230.61" dur="5.779">Until 1923 the Nazis were confident enough to attempt a coup in Munich and seize power</text><text start="237.57" dur="7.699">Known as the Beer Hall Putsch the effort failed and Hitler was arrested before being put on trial, but this only furthered the Nazi cause</text><text start="246.84" dur="7.25">Hitler used the trial to gain even more supporters and despite him spending a year in prison in which he wrote his autobiography Mein Kampf</text><text start="254.61" dur="3.74">The Nazis continued to establish themselves in German politics</text><text start="259.769" dur="7.22">Mein Kampf not only outlined his own story, but it also set about establishing his vision for the future of the German people and</text><text start="267.6" dur="6.769">how he believed subversive groups were holding them back from achieving their destiny through measures such as the Treaty of Versailles</text><text start="274.65" dur="2.24">Which outlined Germany&amp;#39;s surrender terms</text><text start="278.65" dur="4.97">He specifically identified Jews and communists as being leaders of this great international</text><text start="284.02" dur="2.809">Conspiracy to keep the German people down after the war</text><text start="287.86" dur="3.8">Highlighting the harsh conditions imposed on the country by the victorious Allies</text><text start="292.449" dur="3.26">Such as the dissolution of Germany&amp;#39;s Empire and armed forces</text><text start="296.71" dur="7.339">The loss of territory to newly created countries in the East and France in the West and having to pray crippling war reparations</text><text start="304.75" dur="2.959">the book effectively became the Nazi Bible</text><text start="308.259" dur="1.051">by</text><text start="309.31" dur="6.229">1933 the Nazi Party had secured enough political support, but Hitler legally became Chancellor of Germany</text><text start="316.72" dur="7.22">He quickly began passing legislation that would transform Germany into Nazi Germany and the swastika would symbolize this</text><text start="324.37" dur="1.65">reinvigorated country</text><text start="326.02" dur="5.209">the prosecution of Jews Gypsies and political opponents soon became government policy as</text><text start="331.659" dur="6.5">Hitler began preparing Nazi Germany to attain what he saw as his destiny cantered around the concept of the Aryan race</text><text start="339.099" dur="3.53">With himself as the undisputed leader the Fuehrer</text><text start="348.48" dur="3.559">History records that the Second World War began in 1939</text><text start="352.89" dur="7.64">However some historians now argue that it began in 1931 with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in China</text><text start="361.56" dur="5">The Japanese deliberately detonated a bomb by Chinese railway line used by Japanese</text><text start="366.81" dur="3.409">citizens in order to blame it on Chinese dissidents</text><text start="371.04" dur="7.55">This was then used as a pretext to invade the country and Japan would occupy the land there until liberated by the Allies in 1945</text><text start="380.61" dur="3.95">Japanese occupation of Chinese territory was extraordinarily harsh</text><text start="385.14" dur="4.04">Rape and murder were widespread and often encouraged by the Japanese leadership</text><text start="390.45" dur="5.51">While at Pingfang in northeast China a military research unit was set up with a special mission</text><text start="397.41" dur="2">designated unit 731</text><text start="399.75" dur="6.5">thousands of Chinese civilians were used in nightmarish medical experiments to develop biological and chemical weapons</text><text start="406.7" dur="6.52">As well as carry out experimental surgeries often without anesthesia for fear of corrupting the data</text><text start="414.34" dur="5.34">In 1922 Benito Mussolini and his national fascist party rose to power in Italy</text><text start="420.96" dur="7.159">Very soon he began reshaping the Democratic political landscape of the country, into a dictatorship counted around himself</text><text start="429.75" dur="2">Mussolini like Hitler in Germany</text><text start="431.94" dur="3.89">Believed his country had a destiny and wanted to build a new Roman Empire</text><text start="436.71" dur="2.69">beginning with a massive buildup of his armed forces</text><text start="440.19" dur="6.859">he was not afraid to use them and prove this when he sent his forces into Abyssinia modern-day Ethiopia in</text><text start="447.6" dur="4.04">1935 to start the construction of his new empire in Africa</text><text start="452.68" dur="5.92">If Manchuria can be considered the first battle friend of World War two then Abyssinia was the second</text><text start="465.84" dur="4.1">As the 1930s grew on Hitler&amp;#39;s Nazi Party became firmly embedded</text><text start="470.22" dur="3.739">Not just in German politics but into German society on a whole</text><text start="474.63" dur="7.399">The German people had much to thank the Nazi Party for since they had pulled the country after the disparate feat and reinvigorated it</text><text start="482.7" dur="4.369">Promising that Germany would soon be attaining its destiny of becoming a great power again</text><text start="488.04" dur="3.229">Hitler&amp;#39;s appeal and influence was not lost on foreign observers</text><text start="491.789" dur="4.73">Many of whom admired him and even began to sympathize with the Treaty of Germany after the war</text><text start="497.61" dur="3.92">Proof of this was given when Hitler became Time Magazine&amp;#39;s Man of the Year</text><text start="502.65" dur="7.459">This played perfectly into Hitler&amp;#39;s hands as he began making notions of regaining lost territory in the east and west of the country</text><text start="510.81" dur="6.44">The first test of how the Allied powers of Britain and France would respond to his new Germany came in 1935</text><text start="517.83" dur="7.639">When Hitler introduced military conscription which saw the German armed forces swell many times beyond the number permitted by the Treaty of Versailles</text><text start="526.26" dur="2">But the Allies did nothing</text><text start="529.2" dur="4.609">Encouraged by this he then ordered his troops into the Rhineland in 1936</text><text start="534.6" dur="2.48">the Rhineland had been demilitarized in</text><text start="537.54" dur="0.81">1925</text><text start="538.35" dur="2.48">In order to create a safety zone for France</text><text start="540.959" dur="5.63">Who along with Belgium had occupied it for a time due to Germany&amp;#39;s inability to pay war reparations</text><text start="547.98" dur="4.849">Hitler had given secret orders to his men that should they encounter French military resistance</text><text start="553.139" dur="3.77">They were to retreat because Germany was still in no condition to fight a war</text><text start="558.119" dur="6.559">Despite protests by France had the Legion of Nations the precursor to modern-day UN again. They did nothing</text><text start="566.52" dur="6.559">In 1937 British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin stood down and was succeeded by Neville Chamberlain</text><text start="573.75" dur="5.419">Meanwhile Germany continued to rearm and now set their sights on reclaiming the German state land</text><text start="579.78" dur="3.649">Which had been absorbed into Czechoslovakia after the war at</text><text start="584.22" dur="5.479">The same time Hitler looked to his own birth country of Austria to become a part of his new Germany</text><text start="590.01" dur="2.719">Although this was again forbidden by the Versailles Treaty</text><text start="594.93" dur="6.44">Austria and Germany had long had an almost symbiotic relationship and both countries people view the other as cousins</text><text start="602.43" dur="3.95">Austria even had its own Nazi Party and in January 1938</text><text start="606.9" dur="4.459">they attempted their own purge much like Hitler had tried in 1923 the</text><text start="611.85" dur="3.109">purge failed and many leading Austrian Nazis were imprisoned</text><text start="616.23" dur="7.58">Hitler&amp;#39;s propaganda machine went to work creating a false impression that Austrians were rising up in support of their imprisoned Nazis and</text><text start="624.24" dur="1.95">so on March the 12th</text><text start="626.19" dur="1.14">1938</text><text start="627.33" dur="4.07">German troops entered Austrian territory on the pretense of restoring order</text><text start="632.19" dur="6.109">Within weeks the Austrian government was gone, and the country was absorbed into Germany as the province of Ostmark</text><text start="639.36" dur="3.78">a vote on joining Germany claims that 99% of the population</text><text start="643.81" dur="2.929">Supported the move which was known as Anschluss</text><text start="647.8" dur="2.929">Having secured his home nation under greater Germany</text><text start="651.279" dur="4.1">Hitler declared himself as the advocate of all ethnic Germans in Europe and</text><text start="655.99" dur="2">primarily of those in sedate inland</text><text start="658.57" dur="3.5">making clear his intention to absorb the region into Germany a</text><text start="663.49" dur="7.429">Diplomatic crisis was sparked when just like in Austria a sedate inland Nazi Party rose armed and began demanding autonomy from</text><text start="671.26" dur="1.5">Czechoslovakia</text><text start="672.76" dur="7.549">the Czech government tried to negotiate with the sedating Germans while a series of meetings were held between Germany Britain and France to</text><text start="680.44" dur="2">reach an agreement on the crisis</text><text start="682.959" dur="4.73">Culminating in the Munich Agreement, which effectively gave a free hand to Germany&amp;#39;s ambitions</text><text start="688.329" dur="2.21">No Czech, representative was present</text><text start="692.23" dur="3.859">First Hitler took the Sudetenland and then in January 1939</text><text start="696.61" dur="6.71">He invaded and captured the rest of Czechoslovakia in his first act of truly open aggression towards a neighbor</text><text start="704.769" dur="7.13">The conquest of Czechoslovakia raised concerns with the mighty Soviet Union which was in the grip of the paranoid Joseph Stalin</text><text start="713.14" dur="5.839">Hitler had written in Mein Kampf that having to fight a war on two fronts was one of the reasons the Kaiser&amp;#39;s Germany was defeated</text><text start="719.11" dur="3.5">And so having already antagonized London and Paris</text><text start="723.13" dur="6.859">He was far more careful with Moscow and began a diplomatic effort with the Soviet Union to keep them out of events in the West</text><text start="730.42" dur="1.8">in</text><text start="732.22" dur="1.89">August 1939</text><text start="734.11" dur="4.25">German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop met with his German counterpart</text><text start="739.089" dur="2.27">Vyacheslav Molotov in Moscow</text><text start="741.94" dur="4.309">Where the two of them effectively divided up Eastern Europe into two on</text><text start="746.529" dur="3.679">The promise that neither would interfere with the other in those areas</text><text start="750.97" dur="6.14">The Soviet Union had its own interests in Poland and Finland and so was happy to abide by this agreement</text><text start="757.18" dur="3.919">even though Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union were ideological enemies</text><text start="762.16" dur="3.35">Despite this period of cooperation many fouled that it wouldn&amp;#39;t last</text><text start="765.93" dur="4.679">But with Russia at bay Hitler ordered his troops into Poland on September the 1st</text><text start="771.25" dur="2">1939</text><text start="777.37" dur="3.2">The invasion of Poland was the final straw for Britain and France</text><text start="781.149" dur="5.78">there was no justification for the invasion other than to simply capture territory from a foreign land and</text><text start="787.209" dur="2.96">so Britain and France delivered an ultimatum to Hitler</text><text start="791.02" dur="2.299">Withdraw his troops, or there would be war</text><text start="794.23" dur="6.47">The demand was refused and on September the 3rd Neville Chamberlain told the British people they were at war with Germany</text><text start="801.579" dur="2.15">unless we heard from them by</text><text start="804.37" dur="1.589">11 o&amp;#39;clock</text><text start="805.959" dur="6.26">That they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland a state of war</text><text start="812.8" dur="2">Would exist between us I?</text><text start="816.52" dur="5">Have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received and that</text><text start="822.459" dur="5.09">Consequently this country is at war with Germany</text><text start="829.42" dur="7.19">Some of Germany&amp;#39;s more cautious generals had warned Hitler that the country was not yet ready for a second massive European confrontation</text><text start="838.09" dur="5.239">Germany&amp;#39;s rearmament plans predicted war with Britain and France breaking out in 1945</text><text start="843.94" dur="5.929">By which time they would have their own aircraft carrier large u-boat fleets and powerful tank forces</text><text start="850.93" dur="3.529">the generals therefore concocted their blitzkrieg style of war</text><text start="855.52" dur="6.05">Blitzkrieg meant lightning war and called for the widespread use of tanks and aircraft to break through enemy</text><text start="861.82" dur="6.619">Formations to capture a key strategic areas and divide enemy forces up to make them easy to destroy</text><text start="870.34" dur="7.549">Above all it was intended to achieve a quick victory rather than a drawn-out war of attrition which Germany could not afford it</text><text start="879.01" dur="6.71">Was first used in Poland and the Polish army proved totally inadequate for this new form of warfare in</text><text start="886.39" dur="4.88">Less than a month the Polish army was annihilated and the German army the viewmarq</text><text start="891.52" dur="6.44">Began consolidating their positions in western Poland as the Soviet Union invaded the east of the country on</text><text start="898.21" dur="7.34">September the 17th as von Ribbentrop had agreed to and was something that was all but ignored by Britain and France who?</text><text start="905.83" dur="1.98">concentrated on Germany</text><text start="907.81" dur="4.549">Poland ceased to exist as a free country on October the 6th 1939 and</text><text start="912.76" dur="4.55">Nazi Germany now shared a land border with the Communist Soviet Union</text><text start="918.89" dur="7.129">Britain and Frances declaration of war on Germany sends shockwaves across Europe that were felt politically but appear to do very little ounce</text><text start="926.87" dur="6.14">Belgium Holland and Norway joined a chorus of European voices declaring themselves neutral in the fighting</text><text start="933.829" dur="3.32">But in fact this seemed to be very little fighting at all in</text><text start="938" dur="6.709">Terms of helping defend Poland Britain and France could do very little and instead they prepared for when Hitler would charge West</text><text start="945.62" dur="4.88">This was the start of the phoney war a period with both sides seemed to be doing everything</text><text start="950.5" dur="3.089">They would normally do in a war except all-out warfare</text><text start="954.8" dur="7.279">the French mobilized their armed forces and sent them to the border while Britain created the British Expeditionary Force or</text><text start="962.39" dur="2.839">BEF to be sent to France to support them</text><text start="965.87" dur="3.08">Mirroring how the country went to war in 1914</text><text start="970.279" dur="5.15">at sea German u-boats and surface Raiders did sink unprotected merchant ships</text><text start="975.709" dur="6.95">While in the air British aircraft made attacks on German shipping or conducted leaflet drops over the Ruhr region</text><text start="983.48" dur="5.479">During one such leaflet dropping mission on September the 9th a formation of RAF Whitley bombers</text><text start="989.39" dur="3.769">Strayed into Belgian airspace and were attacked by Belgian Fighters</text><text start="993.98" dur="4.669">This forced one of them to land and they lost two aircrafts to British defensive fire</text><text start="999.44" dur="5.179">However in the South Atlantic a drama was about to unfold that would become a naval legend</text><text start="1005.019" dur="6.95">The German pocket battleship Graf Spee was attacking British merchant ships capturing their cruise and then sinking them</text><text start="1012.67" dur="5.33">The crews were then put on the Graf Spee support ship the Altmark for returning to Germany</text><text start="1018.76" dur="3.229">three British cruisers met German ship in the battle and</text><text start="1022.36" dur="5.3">Managed to inflict enough damage to force the German battleship to put into neutral, Montevideo</text><text start="1028.27" dur="2">modern-day Uruguay for repairs</text><text start="1031.389" dur="3.05">while there the British began flooding local media sources</text><text start="1034.689" dur="5.42">That a huge British Armada was assembling to destroy the pocket battleship when it left port</text><text start="1040.779" dur="5.72">The German captain learned of this and believing the situation was hopeless he scuttled his mighty warship</text><text start="1047.649" dur="6.26">in reality there was no Armada, but the deception meant potentially thousands of sailors lives were saved a</text><text start="1054.549" dur="6.8">Few weeks later British special forces raided the Altmark and rescued a number of captured merchant crews</text><text start="1068.91" dur="6.049">Everyone knew the phony war couldn&amp;#39;t last forever, and it would only be a matter of time before Hitler struck west of France</text><text start="1076.11" dur="6.319">In the meantime Britain and France decided to embark on a campaign in Norway then a neutral country</text><text start="1082.559" dur="4.609">but one that along with Sweden helped supply Germany with vital iron all the</text><text start="1087.87" dur="1.2">eyes mined</text><text start="1089.07" dur="7.099">Norwegian harbors from where German ships operated which provoked Hitler to

the belief that the war would be reminiscent of the static nature of World War one</text><text start="1167.58" dur="2">But it was fundamentally flawed</text><text start="1170.1" dur="4.94">It only went as far as north of the Belgian border and despite popular belief at the time</text><text start="1175.11" dur="2.449">It was not a continuous fortification</text><text start="1178.02"

changed very little and new technologies such as ASDIC an early form of sonar</text><text start="2249.6" dur="6.14">Had yet to take prevalence in the fleet meaning the main method to detect a u-boat

combat the new bones saw the rapid development of technology particularly in the field of radar</text><text start="2359.74" dur="3.799">The u-boats had to ride on the surface to charge their batteries that powered them</text><text start="2363.539" dur="2.94">And this was often carried out under the safety of night</text><text start="2367.269" dur="6.62">However radar had been used to combat night

darkness</text><text start="2382.809" dur="3.92">From that point on you boats could be attacked anytime anywhere</text><text start="2387.819" dur="3.469">The situation was made worse for the u-boats
